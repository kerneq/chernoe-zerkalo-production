- Uh-huh.

104
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:22,005
Okay, then. Check the recordings.
Bag that, send it to Toxicology.

105
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:25,885
Full autop for her, and we question
the husband as soon as he wakes up.

Come on.

107
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:52,405

- I'm keeping options open.

108
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,925
Cutting the throat, that's unusual.
Thanks, chaps.

109
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:59,445
- But you do think he did it?
- Don't know anything yet.

118
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:50,205
Not exactly. You've seen
what people tuck away on these.

119
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:54,565
Schemes and kill lists, kiddy porn.
It's not boring.

120
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:57,285

when they walked around with that stuff

122
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:03,765
Right. But now they can't help but
entrusting it to their little companions.

These things absorb who we are.
They know everything about us.

124

If it's interesting,
why leave Forensics?

125
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:16,405
The Rannoch case.

126
00:12:19,485 --> 00:12:22,045
- Ian Rannoch?
- The child killings, yeah.

127
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:26,365
I was the one
who cracked his souvenir folder.

128
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,925
- So you saw those pictures?
- Mm-hmm.

129
00:12:34,005 --> 00:12:37,845

it changes you.

133
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:54,845
Yeah.

134
00:12:56,805 --> 00:12:59,405
- I mean, out here in the field...
- What fucking field?

135
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:04,525
You know what I mean.
Out here in the real world,

136
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:07,445

She was clutching... She was clutching
her head as if she was in pain.

176
00:16:50,805 --> 00:16:52,565
And then for a moment, she stopped.

177
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,165
And then it was like a seizure, she was...

178
00:16:57,685 --> 00:17:02,285
thrashing... clawing at her own skin.

179
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,805
And she turned...

180
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:20,005
She smashed her head...
onto the desk, hard.

181
00:17:20,885 --> 00:17:22,765
Then she... she pushed me over.

182
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:25,405
That must've been when the bottle smashed.

183
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:29,645
Then she picked it up,
and she started cutting herself.

184
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,245
Here. She was gouging.

185
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:38,445
I tried to stop her.

186
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:42,165
But she did this.

187
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:46,125
Then she cut her throat.

188
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:48,925
I tried to stop her.

189
00:17:50,205 --> 00:17:52,445
She cut her own throat with the glass!

190
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:06,525
Mutilated and then killed herself
for no apparent reason?

191
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:08,565
I'd say the odds are against that.

192
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:10,525
He said it was like
she was having a seizure.

193
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,165
Maybe there was something in the cake.

194
00:18:12,245 --> 00:18:14,285
- The cake?
- It had "fucking bitch" iced on it.

195
00:18:14,365 --> 00:18:16,325
- Could've been something in it.
- Like a drug?

196
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,005
- I don't know.
- That makes people kill themselves?

197
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:20,765
He was sort of convincing.

198
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:24,765
- He just doesn't seem the...
- Don't say "the type."

199
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,685
He's ordinary. That <i>is </i>the type.

200
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,685
What, so he bounced her head off the desk?

201
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,205
- Blue.
- Held her steady enough...

202
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:31,685
- Blue.
- What?

203
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:35,205
- Toxicology are looking at the cake.
- Okay.

204
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,885
Meantime, let's drop in
on the person that sent it.

205
00:18:40,565 --> 00:18:41,885
Got the name this morning.

206
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:55,965
- You don't need to patronize me.
- We're doing what you want.

207
00:18:56,045 --> 00:18:58,725
- Following another lead.
- That you think is a waste of time.

208
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:03,165
Picking along dead ends just
to prove they're dead ends,

209
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,805
that's most of the job.

210
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:08,245
I'm not saying it's a waste of time.
Just...

211
00:19:09,165 --> 00:19:11,445
you haven't had a chance
to get bored of reality yet.

212
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,445
Okay, that <i>was</i> patronizing.

213
00:19:22,885 --> 00:19:25,165
- Is this who sent the cake?
- Uh-huh.

214
00:19:26,085 --> 00:19:29,605
- Have we checked her social feeds?
- I don't know.

215
00:19:49,973 --> 00:19:52,351
_

216
00:19:56,885 --> 00:20:01,005
"Death to Jo Powers."
She posted that on Monday morning.

217
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:10,765
The bakery said that they're
not meant to do obscenities,

218
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:14,725
so I said it was for my sister,
like just a joke thing,

219
00:20:14,805 --> 00:20:17,005
and they agreed, so...

220
00:20:18,205 --> 00:20:22,565
Not cheap, their cakes.
With delivery, it was what, 80 quid?

221
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:26,045
Um...
Well, I didn't pay for it all myself.

222
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,685
- We all put a pound in each.
- We?

223
00:20:28,765 --> 00:20:31,165
Yeah. I'm on a mums and carers
message board.

224
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:33,685
I held a sort of whip-round.

225
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:36,405
- You crowd-sourced the money?
- Yeah, if you like.

226
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,965
From 80 other people?

227
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:41,525
Look, I'm not...

228
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:45,325
I'm not being funny, okay?
I know she is dead.

229
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,205
But did you read what she had written?

230
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:52,645
How much do you think she got paid
for spouting that horrible shit?

231
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:54,245
I don't know.

232
00:20:55,525 --> 00:21:00,045
- I was just using my freedom of speech.
- To send a threatening message.

233
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:04,045
It was funny, okay?

234
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,965
And I can see if I'd done it myself,
then that would be a bit weird,

235
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:09,765
but I'm not mental.

236
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,725
You wished she was dead.

237
00:21:17,005 --> 00:21:18,205
Well, uh...

238
00:21:18,565 --> 00:21:20,165
No, no, I didn't.

239
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,885
- "Death to Jo Powers."
- That's just...

240
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:30,765
It's a... a hashtag game, you know,
like "Death to..."

241
00:21:30,845 --> 00:21:33,125
You insert the name
of someone who's being an arsehole.

242
00:21:33,205 --> 00:21:37,045
It's not... real. It's a joke thing.

243
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:39,485
And who started it? The hashtag?

244
00:21:39,565 --> 00:21:41,525
I don't know. I don't know.
I saw it somewhere.

245
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:45,565
Excuse us a moment.

246
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:56,125
Toxicology say the cake's clean.

247
00:21:56,765 --> 00:22:00,125
They also said:
"Thanks, it was delicious."

248
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:06,645
We'll give her a caution.
Offensive Communications Act.

249
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,525
- Does that cover cakes?
- As far as she's concerned, it does.

250
00:22:19,685 --> 00:22:22,845
What about the others who chipped in?
Are you going to tell them off, too?

251
00:22:24,965 --> 00:22:28,565
- I didn't do anything.
- Start a thread about it.

252
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,245
Hospital's discharging the husband
tomorrow.

253
00:22:42,325 --> 00:22:43,885
We'll bring him in for questioning.

254
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:52,005
Blue? We're arresting the husband.
Don't wallow in that.

255
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:54,565
The Internet will be pissed off
with someone else today.

256
00:22:54,645 --> 00:22:56,005
Tusk.

257
00:22:57,645 --> 00:23:00,405
Everyone's pissed off with Tusk
'cause of that thing with the kid.

258
00:23:04,565 --> 00:23:06,725
He's catching a shit storm
on social media.

259
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:10,405
- Liza will be organising the cake now.
- Yeah.

260
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,285
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

261
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:19,481
_

262
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:32,405
- Whoo!
- <i>♪ Turn a penny to a grand ♪</i>

263
00:23:32,485 --> 00:23:35,325
<i>♪ When I'm ready,
rocking steady for my fans ♪</i>

264
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,805
Where my ladies at?

265
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:41,085
- Yo! Good show.
- Yeah, that's a good show, brother.

266
00:23:41,165 --> 00:23:43,485
- I'm feeling my shit.
- You want some of that?

267
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,565
- What you smoking?
- Good shit, boy.

268
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:47,325
A'ight.

269
00:23:48,325 --> 00:23:49,885
Damn!

270
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:52,645
Eyes on, eyes on, eyes on.

271
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,885
Don't stress. It's legal here.

272
00:23:55,965 --> 00:23:59,845
Pfft! Keep forgetting.
Welcome to Europe, I guess.

273
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:03,205
- Kinda takes the joy out of it.
- Tell me about it.

274
00:24:03,285 --> 00:24:06,925
Careful! You break it, you pay for it.

275
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,445
Always doing some bullshit.

276
00:24:10,525 --> 00:24:12,765
Tusk? Tusk?

277
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:17,125
Yo, yo! We need some help over here!

278
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:25,845
- I got you.
- Get it out! Get it out! Get it out!

279
00:24:25,925 --> 00:24:27,285
Call an ambulance!

280
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:20,405
Commencing.

281
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,565
- Did he say what it is?
- Nope.

282
00:27:17,285 --> 00:27:18,805
- Good morning.
- Morning.

283
00:27:27,885 --> 00:27:29,245
She's in here.

284
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:32,805
So I go in,

285
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,845
and there's not just the wound
from the glass.

286
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:39,205
There's a hole. Dug in.
A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.

287
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:42,005
So I follow it, you know,
how deep does it go?

288
00:27:42,085 --> 00:27:45,285
It goes all the way from her ear canal
to deep in her brain.

289
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:50,125
Where I find this.

290
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:52,965
Nestled right in there. Looks quite cosy.

291
00:27:53,925 --> 00:27:56,965
- It's one of those bee things.
- An ADI.

292
00:27:57,765 --> 00:28:00,925
An Autonomous Drone Insect
from the Granular Project.

293
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,365
- How did it get in there?
- I'd say it burrowed in.

294
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:09,245
- Fuck me.
- That's not the worst part.

295
00:28:09,325 --> 00:28:11,925
It crawled right through
her dorsal posterior insula,

296
00:28:12,005 --> 00:28:14,885
which is basically
the brain's pain centre.

297
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:17,805
You're talking agony off the scale.

298
00:28:18,885 --> 00:28:23,285
- You'd do anything to make it stop.
- Even cut your own throat.

299
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:42,245
- Good afternoon.
- DCI Parke.

300
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,845
- TDC Blue Colson.
- Okay. Thank you.

301
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:15,445
They're so fucking fancy-looking,
these companies.

302
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:18,205
- Billions on branding.
- Well, they can afford it.

303
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:21,005
The whole ADI project's pretty much
bankrolled by the government.

304
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:23,085
It's why so many people
are paranoid about it.

305
00:29:23,165 --> 00:29:26,685
Let me guess,
this is some people on the Internet?

306
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,845
They reckon the government
uses the bees to spy on us.

307
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:33,165
There's a schizophrenic world view.

308
00:29:47,205 --> 00:29:51,325
Jesus, I didn't expect to find myself
living in the future,

309
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:52,725
but here I fucking well am.

310
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:57,805
- Karin Parke?
- Uh-huh.

311
00:29:57,885 --> 00:29:59,085
Vanessa Dahl.

312
00:30:01,165 --> 00:30:03,085
Please. Follow me.

313
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:16,125
You're after information
on our Project Swarm ADIs?

314
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:17,845
That's right.

315
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:20,445
Any particular reason?

316
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:22,325
Yes.

317
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:43,885
Rasmus.

318
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,525
Rasmus Sjoberg.

319
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:50,525
- He heads Swarm.
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:30:50,605 --> 00:30:52,685
- Hi.
- Hi.

321
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:56,125
- Nice greenhouse.
- Yeah.

322
00:30:59,365 --> 00:31:02,645
So, your bees, your ADIs,
talk me through them.

323
00:31:02,725 --> 00:31:06,445
Colony Collapse Disorder.
We still don't know what's behind it.

324
00:31:06,525 --> 00:31:09,445
Bees themselves were virtually extinct

325
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:13,645
so what our ADIs do
is effectively stand in for them.

326
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:16,845
They're solar powered.
They don't need nectar.

327
00:31:16,925 --> 00:31:18,725
but they pollinate flowers the same way.

328
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:21,845
They crawl inside,
pollen sticks to their legs

329
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:23,965
and gets brushed off
the next flower they visit.

330
00:31:24,045 --> 00:31:26,525
- Can they make honey?
- Uh... No.

331
00:31:26,605 --> 00:31:28,325
I was joking.

332
00:31:30,445 --> 00:31:34,445
How do they know
where the flowers even are? I mean...

333
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,805
Well, they have a sensor.

334
00:31:36,805 --> 00:31:38,965
Like a... camera?

335
00:31:39,045 --> 00:31:41,805
No. Just a basic visual sensor.

336
00:31:41,885 --> 00:31:44,405
You see,
they need rudimentary pattern recognition

337
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,325
in order to locate compatible flora
and navigate.

338
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,405
- <i>They</i> navigate?
- Yes.

339
00:31:49,485 --> 00:31:53,125
You don't... I don't know... steer them?

340
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,765
They're autonomous.
That's right, isn't it?

341
00:31:55,845 --> 00:31:57,605
They make their own decisions.
They look after themselves.

342
00:31:57,685 --> 00:32:00,765
Yes. You see, the ADIs
cover the whole of the UK.

343
00:32:00,845 --> 00:32:03,445
We couldn't command each one
individually ourselves.

344
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,125
It's just not logistically possible.

345
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:09,165
No. We simply
set the behaviour and leave them to it.

346
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:12,165
They even construct these hives
themselves.

347
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:13,405
They reproduce...

348
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:18,125
- They reproduce?
- Yes. Each hive is a replication point.

349
00:32:18,205 --> 00:32:20,485
- It's like a 3D printer, basically.
- Exactly.

350
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:22,725
They create duplicates of themselves,

351
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:25,765
create more hives
and spread out exponentially.

352
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,405
- Cover the country.
- Maybe you should work here.

353
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:32,285
Yeah, well, I read up on it.
It's impressive.

354
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:36,005
It is. It's just a shame it's necessary.

355
00:32:36,085 --> 00:32:38,685
The alternative would have been
environmental catastrophe.

356
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:40,445
Bees were dying out.

357
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:44,845
So, what is it that brings you here?

358
00:32:46,605 --> 00:32:51,245
We think one of your ADIs
may be involved in an unexplained death.

359
00:32:51,325 --> 00:32:53,285
Sorry? A death?

360
00:32:53,365 --> 00:32:54,645
Uh-huh.

361
00:33:07,965 --> 00:33:09,205
Thank you.

362
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:29,285
Yeah. It's one of ours.
But, look, these are not designed to...

363
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:33,685
Kill people? I'd hope not.
Could it have malfunctioned somehow?

364
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:38,565
No. I mean, when they do malfunction...

365
00:33:38,645 --> 00:33:42,005
It happens, but then they just break,
they just hit the ground.

366
00:33:43,085 --> 00:33:45,885
What if someone hacked one and then
they found a way of controlling it?

367
00:33:45,965 --> 00:33:47,245
That's impossible.

368
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,845
You see,
it's got military-grade encryption,

369
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:53,445
and you would need a diagnostic
controller, which is also encrypted.

370
00:33:53,525 --> 00:33:55,245
So I would say the likelihood is...

371
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,645
I don't know what he's saying,
but it's not the same as "impossible."

372
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:09,085
This is every hive we have online.

373
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:12,405
See...

374
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:17,445
These are the hives in the building here.

375
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:22,205
- How many bees per hive?
- Around 4,000.

376
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:24,605
- It's like air traffic control.
- Yeah.

377
00:34:24,685 --> 00:34:26,485
Is that the search input?

378
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,605
- Yeah, but, uh... you'd need...
- Sorry.

379
00:34:32,965 --> 00:34:36,085
Jo Powers' postcode.

380
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:37,845
Is that who this is about?

381
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,765
- You said you get some malfunctions?
- A fair few, yes.

382
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:43,885
They smack into a car or something.
We even had people trap them.

383
00:34:43,965 --> 00:34:47,085
You know, put them in the microwave
for YouTube videos.

384
00:34:47,165 --> 00:34:48,885
And this logs
any that drop off the system?

385
00:34:48,965 --> 00:34:50,005
Logs everything, yes.

386
00:34:50,085 --> 00:34:52,165
Did you lose any around here
on Monday evening?

387
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:53,565
Well, I can check.

388
00:34:56,325 --> 00:35:01,885
Just one. Went out at 1903 hours.
Here, I can replay.

389
00:35:03,565 --> 00:35:04,725
There.

390
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:09,765
- That's odd.
- What's odd?

391
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,845
When they pass between hives,

392
00:35:11,925 --> 00:35:14,365
they switch from one jurisdiction
to another.

393
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,485
- It's, you know, like a...
- It's like a phone between cell masts?

394
00:35:18,565 --> 00:35:23,125
Exactly. It tried to do that,
but there was nothing to switch to.

395
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:27,965
Unless someone spoofed a hive and then
they've used that to commandeer your ADI.

396
00:35:28,045 --> 00:35:31,125
No, you would need
a diagnostic controller to do that.

397
00:35:31,205 --> 00:35:32,645
What's the range on one of those?

398
00:35:33,325 --> 00:35:35,725
Ten, 20 metres, perhaps.

399
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,885
So whoever was controlling it would have
to be no more than 20 metres away.

400
00:35:39,965 --> 00:35:43,165
- Outside the house.
- Yeah. Sitting in a car, even.

401
00:35:43,245 --> 00:35:46,925
- Can you trace back who did this?
- Yes. I-I'm already trying to do that.

402
00:35:47,005 --> 00:35:48,005
Uh...

403
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:54,365
You know what? Uh...
It would be easier without an audience.

404
00:35:58,445 --> 00:35:59,725
Okay.

405
00:35:59,805 --> 00:36:02,925
You two swap numbers,
keep a line of communication.

406
00:36:03,005 --> 00:36:07,245
Can you shut the whole thing down
if need be... hypothetically speaking?

407
00:36:07,325 --> 00:36:09,325
Even a short stoppage
would damage the ecosystem,

408
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:13,245
and we'd need approval
from the Department of the Environment.

409
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:16,965
We'll need a list of any Granular staff
that had access to that system,

410
00:36:17,045 --> 00:36:18,125
past or present.

411
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:20,125
Some were government employees.

412
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:22,765
Use a different font for those
if it helps.

413
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,805
Bye.

414
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:57,805
Nick, that's a set
of Granular personnel records.

415
00:36:57,885 --> 00:36:59,285
Root out anyone interesting.

416
00:36:59,365 --> 00:37:01,085
Maybe not just one.
Could be a group involved.

417
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:02,885
Technically we should refer this up
to the NCA,

418
00:37:02,965 --> 00:37:05,325
but there's no fucking way
they're taking this off me.

419
00:37:05,405 --> 00:37:06,765
The NCA already knows about it.

420
00:37:08,405 --> 00:37:09,445
What?

421
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:12,805
DCI Karin Parke?

422
00:37:15,085 --> 00:37:17,685
- Yes.
- Shaun Li, National Crime Agency.

423
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:20,005
How come you're here?

424
00:37:21,125 --> 00:37:22,605
There's been more than one.

425
00:37:37,285 --> 00:37:39,285
This is Tusk, last night.

426
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:41,765
- Shit.
- They thought it was a fit.

427
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:42,925
Took him to the hospital.

428
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,805
He had to be anaesthetised
to stop him mutilating himself.

429
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:50,325
X-ray seemed to indicate some kind
of plaque or tumour in his brain

430
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:53,085
so they popped him in the MRI.

431
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:56,885
Yeah. Basically one big magnet.

432
00:37:56,965 --> 00:38:00,125
Tore it right out of his head,
through the eye socket.

433
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,245
Battered the ADI too.

434
00:38:05,205 --> 00:38:08,525
Yours is more intact
so I'm gonna need it for analysis.

435
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,125
It's evidence.

436
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:13,605
Two's a pattern. It knocks
any malfunction theory in the head.

437
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,685
- And they're similar victims.
- Similar?

438
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:19,085
Both in the middle of online shit storms.

439
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:22,525
Well, if you wanna kill someone,
there's a million easier ways to do it.

440
00:38:22,605 --> 00:38:25,685
Pull this off and you've done it
from across the street.

441
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:30,245
No fingerprints, no DNA.
It's like wishing them dead.

442
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,045
Fuck.

443
00:38:49,605 --> 00:38:50,725
Fuck.

444
00:38:54,525 --> 00:38:57,885
Guys? Come here.

445
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:12,205
Okay, so, um... Jo Powers and Tusk,

446
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:14,605
both were being kicked around
the Internet for hours,

447
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,245
but in both their cases,
people were also tweeting their photos

448
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:20,925
accompanied with this hashtag: #DeathTo.

449
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:23,445
- Like our friend the teacher.
- Right.

450
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:27,285
She didn't know where she'd first heard
of it, but trace it back,

451
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,045
and it looks like the first real use
of the hashtag was last weekend.

452
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:33,165
- By who?
- Uh...

453
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,965
Looks like, um...

454
00:39:35,925 --> 00:39:39,125
Looks like identical tweets
from a set of duplicate bot accounts.

455
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:42,125
Um...

456
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:45,605
Automated. It's like spam.

457
00:39:45,685 --> 00:39:49,285
This is someone trying to seed the tag,
you know? Get it out there.

458
00:39:49,365 --> 00:39:53,205
It's like bait. This is someone
wanting people to pick up on it.

459
00:39:54,005 --> 00:39:56,205
Check out the senders' avatar photos.

460
00:39:58,365 --> 00:39:59,925
Bees. Shit.

461
00:40:00,005 --> 00:40:01,605
Okay.

462
00:40:02,685 --> 00:40:03,845
There's more.

463
00:40:04,925 --> 00:40:08,605
So each tweet had a sort of
instruction video attached to it.

464
00:40:08,685 --> 00:40:10,005
- Uh-huh.
- There.

465
00:40:10,085 --> 00:40:12,365
"Game of Consequences"?

466
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,645
It's like an unpopularity contest.

467
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:18,045
Pick someone you don't like and if enough
other people choose the same name,

468
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:20,085
then that's who gets targeted.

469
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:23,445
Here, watch.

470
00:40:23,525 --> 00:40:25,605
<i>Game of Consequences.</i>

471
00:40:27,085 --> 00:40:30,285
- <i>One: Pick a target.</i>
- Oh, my God.

472
00:40:30,365 --> 00:40:34,565
<i>Two: Post their name and photo
with #DeathTo.</i>

473
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:35,645
No.

474
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:41,485
<i>Three: Most popular target
will be eliminated after 5 p.m. each day.</i>

475
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:44,525
<i>Four: Game resets at midnight.</i>

476
00:40:44,605 --> 00:40:46,445
- Oh, no.
- Fuck.

477
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:52,445
Someone's holding a public ballot,
bumping off the top person.

478
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:58,125
- Jesus, it's just mad.
- Yeah, and it's growing.

479
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:05,085
Day one. 63 people used the hashtag
on Jo Powers, okay?

480
00:41:05,165 --> 00:41:09,485
On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.

481
00:41:09,565 --> 00:41:14,485
- Who's using it now?
- There's... There's loads more people.

482
00:41:14,565 --> 00:41:16,525
There's quite a few votes
for the Chancellor.

483
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,365
- Yeah.
- Um...

484
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,205
But at number one...

485
00:41:20,285 --> 00:41:25,725
is 880 people using it
on someone called Clara Meades.

486
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,885
- Who's she?
- Clara Meades.

487
00:41:28,965 --> 00:41:31,845
Okay, um...
it looks like she was at a demo,

488
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:34,605
and she took a selfie
in front of a war memorial.

489
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:38,925
- Pretending to piss on it.
- Nice work, Clara.

490
00:41:39,005 --> 00:41:40,405
Yeah, it's getting near the end
of the vote,

491
00:41:40,485 --> 00:41:42,245
and her mentions are blowing up.

492
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:45,365
- Tusk isn't public knowledge yet?
- Um, no.

493
00:41:45,445 --> 00:41:49,405
So people can't know the hashtag works.
They're using it to scare her.

494
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:53,085
- Yeah, but they're gonna get her killed.
- We need to get to her before five.

495
00:41:53,165 --> 00:41:55,205
Yeah. Pulling her citizens details.

496
00:41:56,845 --> 00:41:58,605
You're not supposed
to have access to that.

497
00:41:58,685 --> 00:42:01,365
Yeah, I know. Just getting her location.

498
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:04,445
There.

499
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:26,572
_

500
00:42:26,652 --> 00:42:28,155
_

501
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:29,760
_

502
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,001
_

503
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:37,245
_

504
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,425
_

505
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:39,965
_

506
00:42:40,045 --> 00:42:41,325
Hello?

507
00:42:44,925 --> 00:42:48,725
Yeah, she is.
All right, all right, hold on.

508
00:42:48,805 --> 00:42:49,605
Clara!

509
00:42:52,525 --> 00:42:57,445
Police. For you.
How did they get my number?

510
00:42:59,045 --> 00:43:01,205
- Hello?
- Clara Meades?

511
00:43:01,285 --> 00:43:02,805
This is DCI Karin Parke, Met Police.

512
00:43:02,885 --> 00:43:05,245
Sorry to track you down like this,
but we think you may be in danger.

513
00:43:05,325 --> 00:43:09,085
Sorry, is this a joke? Because
all this stuff I'm getting is not funny.

514
00:43:09,165 --> 00:43:11,845
I'm not joking.
Stay where you are until we get there.

515
00:43:11,925 --> 00:43:13,645
And keep your windows closed.

516
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,965
I'm setting up a perimeter.

517
00:43:17,045 --> 00:43:18,885
Call Rasmus, we need him across this.

518
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,045
- Rasmus?
- <i>Hi, Blue.</i>

519
00:43:28,125 --> 00:43:30,205
<i>I'm sending you a postcode and my GPS.</i>

520
00:43:30,285 --> 00:43:31,965
I need you to monitor the area.

521
00:43:32,045 --> 00:43:36,165
Track my location and see if you get
anything unusual, any rogue ADIs, yeah?

522
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,325
<i>Yeah, great, good.</i>

523
00:43:37,405 --> 00:43:39,325
Look, if they come back,

524
00:43:39,405 --> 00:43:41,125
I think I can catch them.

525
00:43:41,205 --> 00:43:43,165
<i>I have basically set a trap.</i>

526
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,085
So if they...
if they try it again, we've got them.

527
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:02,805
- Are you Batman?
- They only just rolled them out.

528
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:06,205
This'll turn every red light
between here and there to green.

529
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:09,165
Fuck me. If this is the NCA life,
I should apply for a transfer.

530
00:44:09,245 --> 00:44:10,725
Let's go.

531
00:44:19,578 --> 00:44:21,285
_

532
00:44:21,365 --> 00:44:22,765
We can take her here.

533
00:44:22,845 --> 00:44:24,925
It's a safe house
for terrorist informers usually.

534
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,485
<i>No target sighted.</i>

535
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:48,645
<i>This is a police operation!</i>

536
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:53,045
<i>Everybody vacate their premises now.</i>

537
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:55,245
<i>Please leave...</i>

538
00:45:01,205 --> 00:45:03,485
- What's that?
- Someone's trying to break in.

539
00:45:21,045 --> 00:45:24,885
- Rasmus?
- I just picked up an attempted breach.

540
00:45:24,965 --> 00:45:26,285
Granular, they've got a breach.

541
00:45:29,365 --> 00:45:32,685
- <i>One ADI just went offline.</i>
- Where?

542
00:45:32,765 --> 00:45:36,565
- 800 metres from your location.
- That's outside our cordon.

543
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:38,325
If someone's trying to pilot it this way,

544
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,325
they're gonna turn 'round
the moment they see all these uniforms.

545
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:51,885
Clara Meades? I'm Karin Parke.
Did you pack a bag?

546
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:55,005
- Yeah, it's by the door.
- Right, let's go.

547
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:39,765
- Rasmus got a track on them?
- Not yet.

548
00:46:39,845 --> 00:46:42,605
_

549
00:46:57,925 --> 00:47:01,405
It's just precautionary,
and it's only for one night.

550
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:30,925
Just gotta call in.

551
00:47:36,525 --> 00:47:37,565
Hi.

552
00:47:39,325 --> 00:47:41,045
No, not yet.

553
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:45,965
Hopefully never. Granular are onto it.

554
00:47:47,525 --> 00:47:49,685
Understood.

555
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:05,805
They housed a witness here for a while,
Shaun said.

556
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:09,525
- Must've had kids.
- Have you got kids?

557
00:48:09,605 --> 00:48:10,685
No.

558
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:13,365
No plans.

559
00:48:24,525 --> 00:48:25,645
Up the stairs.

560
00:48:39,925 --> 00:48:44,205
- Rasmus.
- <i>Still nothing. I can't trace it.</i>

561
00:49:00,925 --> 00:49:03,485
At least there's an en-suite.

562
00:49:07,245 --> 00:49:09,205
- Is there nothing?
<i>- No.</i>

563
00:49:09,285 --> 00:49:11,965
<i>Whoever it is,
they've masked their path well.</i>

564
00:49:13,965 --> 00:49:15,325
But that's not...

565
00:49:17,885 --> 00:49:20,245
- Fuck.
<i>- What?</i>

566
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:23,325
- We just lost a whole hive.
- What does that mean?

567
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:24,765
<i>Packed full of ADIs.</i>

568
00:49:24,845 --> 00:49:26,125
Lost them all too.

569
00:49:26,205 --> 00:49:29,045
- No... Rasmus?
- There's thousands of them.

570
00:49:29,125 --> 00:49:32,125
- Where?
- It's close to your location.

571
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:33,605
Rasmus, say that again.

572
00:49:33,685 --> 00:49:37,045
Blue? Blue. It's close...
It's very close to you.

573
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:42,365
- Text it. Text it to me.
- Rasmus. Text it to... Shit.

574
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,565
Do I get to redecorate?

575
00:49:54,165 --> 00:49:57,605
Hello. Hello.

576
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:09,205
No...

577
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:12,405
They've got the whole thing.

578
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:15,525
We're not in control anymore.

579
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:18,205
- They've got the whole thing.
- What are you doing?

580
00:50:19,365 --> 00:50:23,005
- Fix it! Can't you fix it?
- Shut up!

581
00:50:53,685 --> 00:50:55,685
_

582
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:02,765
Shit.

583
00:51:06,165 --> 00:51:08,125
We need to go. Now. Now! Come on!

584
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,925
Go. Go, go, go.

585
00:51:23,085 --> 00:51:25,245
What's... what's happening?

586
00:51:44,605 --> 00:51:45,965
Karin...

587
00:52:00,045 --> 00:52:01,765
In there! Go!

588
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:09,925
- Help me block the gap!
- Tell me what's going on!

589
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,205
You're scaring the shit out of me!

590
00:52:55,965 --> 00:52:57,325
Oh! Fuck!

591
00:53:28,285 --> 00:53:30,965
The fan! The fan!

592
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:41,765
Get it away from me!

593
00:54:54,725 --> 00:54:55,725
Take your time.

594
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,725
I'd seen so many bodies before.

595
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:12,205
At crime scenes, in autopsies.

596
00:55:16,245 --> 00:55:18,325
But I'd never seen anyone die.

597
00:55:20,725 --> 00:55:22,285
And she was right there.

598
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:30,205
And can you describe the reaction
of your colleague, Miss Colson?

599
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:34,325
Blue took it hard.

600
00:55:40,765 --> 00:55:41,765
Uh-huh.

601
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:46,125
I'll shut it down.

602
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:08,845
We thought this was one guy,
some Mr. Mystery in the vicinity,

603
00:56:08,925 --> 00:56:12,045
hijacking one ADI
and personally controlling it.

604
00:56:12,125 --> 00:56:13,445
But there were thousands of them.

605
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,445
- So it can't be that, right?
- No.

606
00:56:15,525 --> 00:56:17,445
- One person can't fly hundreds at once.
- No.

607
00:56:17,525 --> 00:56:20,245
Whoever this is,
they're controlling the whole system.

608
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:22,045
- Do you know where from?
- Could be anywhere.

609
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,805
You need to fucking sort this out!

610
00:56:32,165 --> 00:56:34,565
How do the ADIs know who to target?

611
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,325
Could've found Clara the same way
you did, the identity database?

612
00:56:39,405 --> 00:56:41,325
No. That just gives you the basic area.

613
00:56:41,405 --> 00:56:44,125
We were in the room too,
and they only went for her.

614
00:56:46,805 --> 00:56:49,925
Facial recognition.
It's got to be facial recognition.

615
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:53,245
Which means the feed from their visual
sensors, that's been accessed too.

616
00:56:53,325 --> 00:56:55,045
- That's not possible.
- It's the only explanation.

617
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:59,125
Now look, the visual feed is secure
between each ADI and the hive.

618
00:56:59,205 --> 00:57:01,005
- There you go.
- Although...

619
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,605
one of the government's conditions
for backing the project...

620
00:57:03,685 --> 00:57:04,725
Okay. Enough.

621
00:57:04,805 --> 00:57:09,365
We had to consent to permitting
government security services

622
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:14,525
access to the visual feed at times
of quote, "increased national security."

623
00:57:14,605 --> 00:57:18,285
Which is, as I understand it,
pretty much all the time.

624
00:57:18,845 --> 00:57:20,525
- I wasn't happy about it.
- Your lot went along with it.

625
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:24,525
That implies a greater range
of options than your lot presented.

626
00:57:26,165 --> 00:57:28,445
- So they <i>are</i> spying on us.
- This is all classified.

627
00:57:28,965 --> 00:57:33,445
So what did you do, did you put in
a back door and route it through GCHQ?

628
00:57:33,525 --> 00:57:36,485
I mean, you do CCTV, you do traffic cams.

629
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,445
So what don't you have
your fucking noses in?

630
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:42,165
Look, millions of those things
flying around, propping up the ecosystem?

631
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:45,125
Well, that's great, save the planet,
hallelujah!

632
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:47,645
Government's not going
to pump billions into it

633
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:51,245
just 'cause some lab coat says so,
and it grabs 200 green votes.

634
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:54,285
They saw an opportunity to get more,
they took it.

635
00:57:54,365 --> 00:57:57,005
Total nationwide surveillance.

636
00:57:57,085 --> 00:57:59,565
We tracked suspects for weeks
in ways they couldn't dream of.

637
00:57:59,645 --> 00:58:03,245
- We prevented bombings, mass shootings.
- By spying on the public.

638
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:05,365
And keeping them safe,
which is what they want.

639
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:07,325
Clara Meades isn't safe, though,
is she, Shaun?

640
00:58:08,765 --> 00:58:11,045
Knowing what you knew,
that might've helped us,

641
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:12,805
but no,
you kept your little fucking secret.

642
00:58:12,925 --> 00:58:17,805
Okay! The government's a cunt.
We knew that already.

643
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:20,485
Word's going to get out about Clara.

644
00:58:20,565 --> 00:58:25,125
The public's going to wake up and find
this mental assassination game going on,

645
00:58:25,205 --> 00:58:27,525
and soon we're going to have another body.

646
00:58:29,085 --> 00:58:31,165
- So what do we do?
- I don't know.

647
00:58:31,245 --> 00:58:34,325
We're totally locked out. Totally blind.

648
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:36,965
If I can work out how they got in,

649
00:58:37,045 --> 00:58:41,205
I might be able to reverse engineer
some means of getting control back.

650
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:44,045
Do the ADIs have a command log,
on-board cache?

651
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:46,325
- Yeah, but that's encrypted.
- I'll need the key to that.

652
00:58:57,485 --> 00:59:00,085
Been through the employee files,
found some POIs.

653
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:02,005
Bring them in.

654
00:59:04,005 --> 00:59:06,485
Are you sitting in on these?
Granular interviews?

655
00:59:06,565 --> 00:59:07,725
I've got to be somewhere.

656
00:59:21,685 --> 00:59:23,445
<i>It's 7:15.</i>

657
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:27,125
<i>Three deaths have now been linked
to a hashtag circulating on social media.</i>

658
00:59:27,205 --> 00:59:29,165
<i>Controversial journalist Jo Powers...</i>

659
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:32,045
<i>Good morning.
Have you posted the hashtag?</i>

660
00:59:32,125 --> 00:59:33,725
<i>Is it real or an urban myth?</i>

661
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:37,805
<i>Well, thousands have been taking part,
but how culpable are they?</i>

662
00:59:37,885 --> 00:59:41,005
<i>People are dying,</i>
<i>and</i> we <i>want to hear your thoughts.</i>

663
00:59:41,085 --> 00:59:42,645
<i>Line seven, Liana...</i>

664
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:45,245
<i>This is real, this is happening...</i>

665
00:59:45,365 --> 00:59:47,405
<i>I am happy to see her die.</i>

666
00:59:47,485 --> 00:59:51,165
<i>It's not the hashtag killing them.
That's just a game.</i>

667
00:59:51,245 --> 00:59:54,565
<i>Like, if you're an arsehole,
you deserve to be shamed.</i>

668
00:59:54,685 --> 00:59:56,165
<i>Steve, line five.</i>

669
00:59:56,245 --> 00:59:58,965
<i>Yeah, but my point is,
someone's gotta be top of the list, yeah?</i>

670
00:59:59,045 --> 01:00:02,125
<i>So why not make it someone,
you know, who deserves it, like a racist.</i>

671
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:05,045
<i>With the hashtag, I've seen
celebrities, politicians, everyone.</i>

672
01:00:05,125 --> 01:00:08,165
<i>This doesn't mean you have to sit there
encouraging people to take part.</i>

673
01:00:08,245 --> 01:00:10,365
<i>The point is this is already happening.</i>

674
01:00:10,445 --> 01:00:11,845
<i>And people know that they can jump onboard</i>

675
01:00:11,925 --> 01:00:14,285
<i>because nobody will ever know
if they did or didn't.</i>

676
01:00:14,365 --> 01:00:17,165
<i>Well, let's just pause for a moment
and go back to that top five.</i>

677
01:00:17,245 --> 01:00:20,485
<i>As we have been saying,
the Chancellor is at number one,</i>

678
01:00:20,565 --> 01:00:22,285
<i>and I want us to think about that.</i>

679
01:00:22,365 --> 01:00:24,525
<i>What does that tell us
about the choice of the nation?</i>

680
01:00:24,605 --> 01:00:28,405
<i>Well, I can't say I'm surprised
that he's number one on the list.</i>

681
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:30,725
<i>He's been pretty unpopular
for quite a long time now.</i>

682
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:33,125
<i>But does that warrant
his place on this list?</i>

683
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:35,885
<i>I'm saying people
don't have to think too hard about it.</i>

684
01:00:36,005 --> 01:00:37,085
<i>Now that's he's number one,</i>

685
01:00:37,165 --> 01:00:40,725
<i>that should generate more discussions
and probably more votes.</i>

686
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,585
_

687
01:00:57,005 --> 01:00:58,485
Thanks for your time.

688
01:01:05,405 --> 01:01:08,285
- No good?
- No good.

689
01:01:34,605 --> 01:01:37,245
- Well, that's all fascinating...
- Shaun.

690
01:01:37,325 --> 01:01:39,605
- But when do we shut it down?
- Tom.

691
01:01:39,685 --> 01:01:42,845
Forgive me for being sceptical
about your agency's basic competence.

692
01:01:42,925 --> 01:01:45,325
- Tom.
- I'm on the fucking chopping block here.

693
01:01:45,405 --> 01:01:48,005
Number one on the list.
The people's fucking choice!

694
01:01:48,085 --> 01:01:50,045
Farrington's number four,
and he's a paedophile.

695
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:53,365
- Suspected paedophile.
- He did it. You know he did.

696
01:01:56,605 --> 01:02:01,045
Let's just shut it down. All social media.
The whole bloody Internet, pull the plug.

697
01:02:01,805 --> 01:02:03,005
Just for today,

698
01:02:03,085 --> 01:02:04,685
at least until Thumbelina here
pulls his finger out

699
01:02:04,765 --> 01:02:06,085
and he actually catches someone.

700
01:02:06,165 --> 01:02:08,085
I wouldn't advise shutting things down.

701
01:02:08,165 --> 01:02:10,725
- But it's possible? We can do that?
- The whole of social media?

702
01:02:10,805 --> 01:02:14,245
- Yeah. Pull a North Korea on it.
- Well, yes, technically.

703
01:02:14,325 --> 01:02:16,365
- Right, so push the off switch.
- That's not a good idea.

704
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:18,645
- No?
- Not in my opinion.

705
01:02:18,725 --> 01:02:24,325
Right, okay. It's just that speaking
as a marked man, I beg to fucking differ.

706
01:02:24,405 --> 01:02:26,725
If we shut it down,
you'll still be number one.

707
01:02:26,805 --> 01:02:27,805
Guaranteed to be, in fact.

708
01:02:27,885 --> 01:02:31,365
He's right. If we let it run on,
at least there's a few hours.

709
01:02:31,925 --> 01:02:34,725
Anything could happen before five o'clock.
The vote might change.

710
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:38,125
Yeah, and it might not.
What about that report? The archive job?

711
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:41,205
From 1985, that memo about Farrington?

712
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:44,085
- That was over an unrelated matter.
- Leak it.

713
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:46,005
Tom, that would be a smear.

714
01:02:46,085 --> 01:02:48,125
A head-to-toe shit smear,
I fucking hope so.

715
01:02:48,205 --> 01:02:50,725
He's in his 80s. He's had his life.
Fuck him under the bus.

716
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:55,325
If I could suggest an alternative?
We move you to a safe location.

717
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:59,645
- Have you secured before five.
- Worked out well for you last night.

718
01:03:00,725 --> 01:03:01,525
I'll show you.

719
01:03:13,605 --> 01:03:16,925
This next one's Tess Wallender.
She was a junior.

720
01:03:17,005 --> 01:03:18,845
So not much
in the way of technical skills.

721
01:03:18,925 --> 01:03:21,805
- Quit Granular for personal reasons.
- Nervous exhaustion, yeah.

722
01:03:21,885 --> 01:03:25,125
Worked in Human Resources
for Granular until she quit.

723
01:03:25,205 --> 01:03:28,525
She took a photo of a guy on the Tube,
said he'd harassed her,

724
01:03:28,605 --> 01:03:29,725
lewd comments or something.

725
01:03:29,805 --> 01:03:33,165
Turned out he had a learning disability
so she caught a ton of shit on...

726
01:03:33,245 --> 01:03:34,725
On social media.

727
01:03:43,205 --> 01:03:46,085
- Hello. I'm DCI Karin Parke.
- Hi.

728
01:03:46,251 --> 01:03:48,438
_

729
01:03:55,245 --> 01:04:01,685
It was like having a whole weather system
turn against me.

730
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:07,165
Just hate message after hate message,
around the clock, all piling on.

731
01:04:09,165 --> 01:04:11,685
It's hard to describe what that does
to your head.

732
01:04:12,245 --> 01:04:15,685
Suddenly
there's a million invisible people,

733
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:19,045
all talking about how they despise you.

734
01:04:21,005 --> 01:04:23,325
It's like a mental illness.

735
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:29,885
Fuck.

736
01:04:33,845 --> 01:04:34,925
What?

737
01:04:41,205 --> 01:04:42,245
Shit.

738
01:04:43,325 --> 01:04:46,405
I mean, hands up, I made a mistake,

739
01:04:46,485 --> 01:04:50,965
but the way people enjoyed kicking me,
that's what got to me.

740
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:57,445
The casual fun they had and, um...

741
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:01,845
I just felt I couldn't go on.

742
01:05:06,605 --> 01:05:07,765
Who found you?

743
01:05:10,525 --> 01:05:13,525
Um... Garrett, my flatmate.

744
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:16,765
He found me in the bath
five minutes after I'd slashed them.

745
01:05:19,205 --> 01:05:21,645
I mean, it's crazy.

746
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:25,325
I'm half-conscious.
He's dragging me out of the bath,

747
01:05:25,405 --> 01:05:28,725
and I'm telling him to get out,
saying, "I'm naked."

748
01:05:30,485 --> 01:05:34,565
He tied towels 'round my wrists,
kept me conscious,

749
01:05:34,645 --> 01:05:39,725
kept stroking my hair
till the ambulance arrived, talking to me.

750
01:05:42,205 --> 01:05:43,965
Sort of weird.

751
01:05:45,245 --> 01:05:47,525
I think he always had a thing for me.

752
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:51,525
And we worked at the same place so,
you know... awkward.

753
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:55,125
- He worked at Granular?
- Yeah. On the ADI thing.

754
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:59,925
- He was a real wunderkind. Ultra-smart.
- What did you say his name was?

755
01:06:00,925 --> 01:06:04,085
Garrett. Garrett Scholes.

756
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,125
Garrett Scholes.
We need the whereabouts of a Garrett...

757
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:14,325
Scholes. We were about to tell you.

758
01:06:14,405 --> 01:06:16,725
It was buried in the on-board memory
of the Jo Powers' ADI.

759
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:20,525
- What was?
- A manifesto. A 98-page manifesto.

760
01:06:20,605 --> 01:06:22,725
_

761
01:06:22,805 --> 01:06:25,285
And check this out.
There's fucking selfies in it.

762
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:40,485
<i>So we're good to go?</i>

763
01:06:48,805 --> 01:06:50,325
<i>Okay, that's the charge in place.</i>

764
01:06:50,445 --> 01:06:53,405
Okay. Pull back.

765
01:06:57,805 --> 01:06:59,525
<i>We're all set here.</i>

766
01:06:59,605 --> 01:07:00,765
Detonate.

767
01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:11,645
So, the plan is,
we move you to an underground bunker,

768
01:07:12,405 --> 01:07:14,925
knock out every hive
within a ten-mile radius.

769
01:07:15,005 --> 01:07:16,925
And, what, just leave me there?
How long for?

770
01:07:17,605 --> 01:07:18,885
It's a temporary measure.

771
01:07:20,565 --> 01:07:22,765
How long till you take out all the hives?

772
01:07:22,845 --> 01:07:26,365
There's 20,000, 30,000 of them.
That would take two years.

773
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:28,285
Two years, a victim a day.

774
01:07:28,365 --> 01:07:30,405
More to the point,
the environmental impact would...

775
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:32,125
Fuck that.

776
01:07:32,205 --> 01:07:33,725
<i>Shit!</i>

777
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:36,365
- <i>What?
- Fuck!</i>

778
01:07:36,925 --> 01:07:39,765
<i>Stay back, stay back!</i>

779
01:07:39,845 --> 01:07:41,165
<i>Get back!</i>

780
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:49,805
<i>Go, go, go! Get away!</i>

781
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:54,845
<i>For fuck's sake, move!</i>

782
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:05,845
What's your Plan B?

783
01:08:38,205 --> 01:08:41,525
He was on the original employee roster,
but we discounted him.

784
01:08:41,605 --> 01:08:43,005
He left the country six months ago.

785
01:08:43,085 --> 01:08:44,925
We thought we were looking
for someone nearby.

786
01:08:45,005 --> 01:08:47,525
Run a full trace on him.
Everything we can find.

787
01:08:47,605 --> 01:08:50,805
Lunatic with production values,
that's the worst kind.

788
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:54,085
"Thanks to the technological revolution,

789
01:08:54,165 --> 01:08:59,005
we have the power to rage and accuse,
spout bile without consequence.

790
01:08:59,085 --> 01:09:02,605
Only by being forced to recognize
the power technology grants us,

791
01:09:02,685 --> 01:09:04,925
to acknowledge
individual responsibility..."

792
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:06,885
Is it all like this?

793
01:09:07,445 --> 01:09:11,525
He likens the population to insects,
says we revel in cruelty,

794
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:14,125
that it's a weakness
that should be bred out of us.

795
01:09:14,205 --> 01:09:18,285
Recurrent theme is he wants people to face
the consequences of what they say and do.

796
01:09:18,365 --> 01:09:22,165
- Wants to force that on them.
- The whole thing's a moral lesson?

797
01:09:25,605 --> 01:09:27,925
He wanted us to find this
and spread it about.

798
01:09:28,005 --> 01:09:29,285
Well, fuck him.

799
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:43,154
_

800
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:47,864
_

801
01:09:49,525 --> 01:09:50,565
Fuck.

802
01:10:02,358 --> 01:10:04,245
_

803
01:10:21,728 --> 01:10:23,277
_

804
01:10:30,405 --> 01:10:31,645
Shit.

805
01:10:33,485 --> 01:10:37,165
Karin. Karin. He's messed up.

806
01:10:40,405 --> 01:10:42,925
He's put this document
together himself, right?

807
01:10:43,005 --> 01:10:46,325
His author name's in the metadata.

808
01:10:46,405 --> 01:10:48,005
But he stripped out everything else,

809
01:10:48,085 --> 01:10:50,165
so we don't know when he's written it,
for example.

810
01:10:50,245 --> 01:10:51,125
Mm-hmm.

811
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,925
Most of the photos are clipart
off the Internet, except this one.

812
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:57,445
- The selfie.
- That's where he's screwed up.

813
01:10:57,525 --> 01:11:00,405
He's taken it with his phone,
and the phone left a geotag on the image.

814
01:11:00,485 --> 01:11:04,285
- So you know where he took this?
- I know precisely where.

815
01:11:04,365 --> 01:11:07,485
He's here and Granular HQ is there.

816
01:11:20,748 --> 01:11:23,467
_

817
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,885
- Armed police! Stay down!
- Armed police!

818
01:11:54,205 --> 01:11:57,405
Armed police! Stay where you are!
Armed police! Show yourselves!

819
01:12:05,805 --> 01:12:07,005
Move!

820
01:12:08,485 --> 01:12:09,525
Left.

821
01:12:10,805 --> 01:12:12,165
- Clear!
- Clear!

822
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:13,965
Clear!

823
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,565
Lifestyles of the rich and famous.

824
01:13:18,405 --> 01:13:20,565
There. The forge.

825
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,565
Nice one.

826
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:33,605
Half the drives I sifted in forensics
had scorch marks on 'em.

827
01:13:45,805 --> 01:13:49,765
- What do you think?
- Yeah. Looks like his toolkit.

828
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:53,245
- You can use it?
- Pretty much the key to the door.

829
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:57,005
So you can get control back?
Send the deactivation?

830
01:13:57,085 --> 01:13:59,125
Well, I've got his source code.

831
01:14:00,205 --> 01:14:02,485
- I should be able to bounce him out.
- Be quick.

832
01:14:02,565 --> 01:14:04,285
Key to the door?

833
01:14:04,365 --> 01:14:07,445
Our guy doesn't seem the type
to leave keys lying around.

834
01:14:08,525 --> 01:14:09,925
Well, I'm in.

835
01:14:10,485 --> 01:14:12,925
Okay. Deactivate her.

836
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:16,565
- Yeah, I need to repair permissions.
- Fucking hell.

837
01:14:21,405 --> 01:14:22,885
That's weird.

838
01:14:22,965 --> 01:14:24,405
What's weird?

839
01:14:24,485 --> 01:14:27,605
- Time's ticking.
- That file. Wasn't there before.

840
01:14:28,205 --> 01:14:29,285
- This file?
- Yeah.

841
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:36,805
What is it?

842
01:14:41,605 --> 01:14:44,125
- Blue?
- I think they're IMEI numbers.

843
01:14:45,005 --> 01:14:46,525
What does that mean?

844
01:14:46,605 --> 01:14:51,685
Every phone, every device
has a unique number, an IMEI number.

845
01:14:51,765 --> 01:14:53,925
It tethers it to a unique user.

846
01:14:54,005 --> 01:14:57,445
- Yeah.
- But I can check, just... reverse lookup.

847
01:14:57,525 --> 01:14:58,845
Take it easy.

848
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,445
Who are these people?

849
01:15:01,525 --> 01:15:04,525
I don't know.
There's 387,000 of them.

850
01:15:04,605 --> 01:15:06,765
Are these IDs
your spooks have been collecting?

851
01:15:06,845 --> 01:15:09,925
- No! Are you ready yet?
- Yeah, almost there.

852
01:15:10,005 --> 01:15:11,445
Wait. Wait.

853
01:15:12,205 --> 01:15:14,925
What was the name of that teacher?
Hate cake.

854
01:15:15,005 --> 01:15:17,165
- Liza. Liza Bahar.
- Liza Bahar.

855
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:21,685
Fuck's sake.

856
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:28,245
This is a list of everyone
who's used the hashtag.

857
01:15:28,325 --> 01:15:29,325
What?

858
01:15:29,405 --> 01:15:31,645
Everyone who took part
in the Game of Consequences.

859
01:15:31,725 --> 01:15:35,285
They've hoovered up their ID from GCHQ
by the looks of it.

860
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:38,165
That backdoor worked both ways, it seems.

861
01:15:39,805 --> 01:15:42,125
- See if I'm on there.
- What?

862
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,365
I posted the tag earlier
with Scholes' face.

863
01:15:46,005 --> 01:15:49,165
- Just trying to get a reaction from him.
- Yeah, yeah, almost there.

864
01:15:49,245 --> 01:15:50,045
Yeah, you're there.

865
01:15:52,325 --> 01:15:53,805
Almost there.

866
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:58,325
Why has he collected everyone
who took part? I mean...

867
01:16:00,205 --> 01:16:02,085
Okay. I'm ready.

868
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:05,605
- Shit.
- Run it now.

869
01:16:05,685 --> 01:16:08,525
No. Think. He left us a trail.

870
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,605
- Oh, come on.
- That photo with the whereabouts,

871
01:16:10,685 --> 01:16:13,165
it's too big a mistake for him.
He knew we'd do this.

872
01:16:13,245 --> 01:16:17,725
- Now we're shutting it down, all right?
- And maybe that'll trigger some endgame,

873
01:16:17,805 --> 01:16:19,245
something to do with that list.

874
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:24,565
What if those are his real targets?

875
01:16:25,605 --> 01:16:29,085
The people on the list.
Everyone who took part.

876
01:16:30,765 --> 01:16:32,525
Consequences.

877
01:16:32,605 --> 01:16:36,965
The hate figures were the bait.
The players are the target.

878
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,365
- Run the deact command.
- Now just wait a minute, okay?

879
01:16:42,445 --> 01:16:43,565
- Run it.
- No!

880
01:16:44,565 --> 01:16:45,925
_

881
01:16:57,325 --> 01:16:59,125
Yeah.

882
01:17:01,445 --> 01:17:02,525
Yeah, it worked.

883
01:17:05,045 --> 01:17:08,085
Sorry, but that needed doing.

884
01:17:14,165 --> 01:17:17,845
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What?

885
01:17:17,925 --> 01:17:19,565
No. No.

886
01:17:21,885 --> 01:17:23,525
- Fuck!
- No.

887
01:17:27,605 --> 01:17:29,005
Shit.

888
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,085

908
01:22:04,005 --> 01:22:09,365
We're all tragically familiar with
the rest of the events of that week.

909
01:22:11,205 --> 01:22:14,845
And we need no reminding
of the sheer scale

910
01:22:14,925 --> 01:22:17,765
of the loss of life that followed.

911
01:22:20,405 --> 01:22:23,525
No. No, we don't.

912
01:23:05,005 --> 01:23:06,965
And what became of Ms. Colson?

913
01:23:10,405 --> 01:23:12,525
I think she blamed herself.

914
01:23:13,365 --> 01:23:16,445
No. I know she did.

915
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:23,845
She felt she'd followed his breadcrumb
trail and sprung the whole thing.

916
01:23:29,205 --> 01:23:31,045
She left the force.

917
01:23:32,205 --> 01:23:34,285
I didn't hear from her.

918
01:23:35,205 --> 01:23:38,165
Rang her, tried emailing, but no response.

919
01:23:41,405 --> 01:23:42,925
Then, um...

920
01:23:47,805 --> 01:23:53,805
About four months later,
they found her things.

921
01:23:53,885 --> 01:23:55,525
On a beach.

922
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:58,005
With a note.

923
01:24:15,005 --> 01:24:16,165
She killed herself?

924
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:23,365
That's the base theory, yes.

925
01:24:29,205 --> 01:24:33,805
Ms Parke, I would like to commend you

926
01:24:33,885 --> 01:24:37,365
for sharing your testimony and your time.

927
01:24:39,405 --> 01:24:40,445
Thank you.

928
01:24:43,005 --> 01:24:44,005
Thank you.

930
01:25:58,925 --> 01:25:59,765
Señor.

931
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:05,565
- Gracias.
