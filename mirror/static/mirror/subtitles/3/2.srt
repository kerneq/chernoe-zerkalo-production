1
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,280
I'm gonna have to ask you
to switch that off for now.

2
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
Okay, thanks.

3
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,640
You know what it's kinda like?
It's kinda like a rollercoaster.

4
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,960
You know what I mean?
It's like a roller coaster.

5
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,560
Try it, try it with me.

6
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,600
How tall-- How tall is the Eye?

7
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,440
How tall-- How tall is Big Ben?

8
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,360
Since then, I've been working
as a technology correspondent

9
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,320
for about two years now.
It's been great.

10
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,960
Cool, that's awesome. So you do, like,
TV reports and, like, you're like...

11
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,240
-No, just the website.
-Oh, just the website?

12
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,880
I mean, there's some video stuff,
but tech industry pieces mainly.

13
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
Cool, tech. Tech's awesome. Tech's--

14
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,320
So where have you been so far?

15
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,160
Travelling around the map
like Indiana Jones?

16
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,600
-Yeah.
-Where the adventure line

17
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,760
goes zigzagging all over the place.

18
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
Yeah, actually, I'm almost done. Uh...

19
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,840
But I started off, flew into Sydney,
went to Thailand.

20
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,680
-Oh, jealous.
-India. Yeah.

21
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,360
Did Rome, went to Rome.

22
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,240
-Did the whole Europe vacation.
-Even I haven't done that.

23
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,480
-Oh, really?
-Mm.

24
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,880
It was awesome.
I went to Pamplona in Spain.

25
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,240
-Is that where they do the bull runs?
-Ran with the bulls.

26
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,160
-You ran with the bulls?
-I ran with the bulls.

27
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,960
-That's how I got this.
-Look at that!

28
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,360
You really are Indiana Jones.

29
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,480
Have you got your whip in your bag
and your hat?

30
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
I saved the world from the Nazis.
That was pretty cool.

31
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,840
I, you know, just... trying to do,
you know, shit I've never done before.

32
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,360
Is that what you're doing on this trip?
You're, like, finding yourself?

33
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,160
Yeah, um... in a way. I mean, I--

34
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,480
Really to get away from the family home
is what I'm doing.

35
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,760
Oh.

36
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,720
Yeah, that was-- Whatever, that's boring.

37
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
Yeah, well,
I'm afraid Britain's pretty tame

38
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,480
as far as daredevil opportunities go.

39
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,480
Yeah? It's alright, it's the last leg
of the trip anyway so...

40
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,080
I'm... unfortunately home next week.

41
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
-Not much time--
-Next week?

42
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,520
-Yeah.
-That's not very long.

43
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,240
-No, it's not.
-Mnh-mnh.

44
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,800
So... I could use some suggestions
on fun shit to do.

45
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
-Hmm. Fun shit to do?
-Fun shit to do.

46
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Ow! Ow!

47
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,680
Jesus!

48
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,120
Hello.

49
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,240
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

50
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,280
Oh. Another battle scar.

51
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,880
Kind of.

52
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,760
Let me guess, you were, like,

53
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,640
totally shark fishing
in Cape Town, dude.

54
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,640
Is that your best American accent?

55
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,880
-Yes.
-That's pretty good. No, um...

56
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,080
It was courtesy of Josh Peters,
high school dick.

57
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,520
He and I got into a fight in shop class.

58
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,880
And he hit me with this,
like, metal rod thing.

59
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,480
What an arsehole.

60
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,240
What an arsehole.

61
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,400
-That's terrible.
-I'm sorry.

62
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,560
Is that you or me?

63
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,160
Oh, it's gotta be you.

64
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,680
"Mom." You're so American.

65
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Yes, I am.

66
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,640
Are you not gonna get that?

67
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,920
Okay, that was a little impersonal.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,560
What, you wanna talk to her now?

69
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,960
-You wanna talk to my mum? I'll call back.
-Fair point.

70
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't think so.

71
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,160
You hungry?

72
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:54,280
Wow, look at all these games.
You're, like, a gamer. Cool.

73
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course I am. For my job.

74
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,720
What, a girl never beat you
at <i>Street Fighter</i>?

75
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,920
Is this--
Like, this is, like, your dating manual?

76
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,040
What?<i> The Singularity?</i>

77
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,240
It's when computers learn to outsmart man
like women did years ago.

78
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Oh! Wow!

79
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,600
See, what I was doing, it was like a joke.

80
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,720
-You know?
-Really?

81
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,240
-Yeah.
-Well, that's what you call a joke?

82
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,280
Mm-hmm. Yeah, you guys have those.

83
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,120
-You guys have those here, right?
-Yeah, yeah. We do at the moment.

84
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,440
Ow!

85
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,800
That was a good joke.
That was a good joke.

86
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,080
Enjoy your Marmite.

87
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Whoa! Oh, my...

88
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,240
Do you guys seriously eat this shit?

89
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,920
Okay, alright.

90
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,280
Alright, saved by mum.

91
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,520
The best way to actually just stop her
from calling is...

92
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,520
I don't know, answer it.

93
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,040
Yeah, it's kind of like a can of worms
I just don't wanna open right now, so...

94
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,000
She's worried. You're her son.
You've been travelling,

95
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,880
and I just think if you speak to her,
then...

96
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,320
Yeah, well, I still live at home
with her back in Syracuse.

97
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,160
-That's cool. That's fine.
-Yeah.

98
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,000
I was taking care of my dad.

99
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,520
Oh, shit. Is he...?

100
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,760
-...okay?
-No, he died.

101
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,960
-Oh, my God. I'm sorry.
-Last year. No, it's okay.

102
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,920
It was coming for a while.
It was early onset Alzheimer's.

103
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh, that must have been really...
uh... tough.

104
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,680
Yeah, he was my best friend.

105
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,920
Sometimes he'd just look at me
and wouldn't even know who I was.

106
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,760
Well, my mum, like, I don't even--
I don't know how to talk to her.

107
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,480
You know, I don't have that connection.
I don't even know where to start.

108
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,840
So that's why I left.
That's why I went on this trip.

109
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,200
Just to get away and make,
you know, all the memories that I can...

110
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
while I can.

111
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,680
And I know I gotta talk to her
and I gotta just...

112
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,720
But not on this.
You know, I just-- I'll deal with it.

113
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,240
I'll deal with it when I get back,
you know. I'll just...

114
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
You're a good guy, Cooper.

115
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,080
Call your mum.

116
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,080
Zero, zero, one, nine,
three, nine, two, nine.

117
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,920
No, I did not buy a pair of sandals
in Koh Samui last night

118
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
because I'm in--

119
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,040
And how long does that take?

120
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,760
Because I need to buy a ticket back
to America.

121
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,080
Oh, my God.

122
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,400
Mm-hmm.

123
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,480
Can I just say, this is the most blatant
cover story for a second hook-up ever?

124
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,240
Yes! Yes! Oh, my God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

125
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,520
Alright. Don't forget your bag.

126
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,840
The bag, yep, my bag.
Alright. You are a top bird.

127
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,200
I don't know what that means, but I heard
somebody say it once, and you're it.

128
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,640
I got a plan.

129
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,440
Yeah. It's odd jobs.

130
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,440
-For who?
-For, like, it's an app.

131
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,400
You can kind of-- like, I've used it
all over when funds were low, so...

132
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,400
-Oh, there's some interesting ones.
-Pretty cool.

133
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,080
-"Thrillseekers wanted."
-Ooh.

134
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,680
-This looks right up your street.
-Okay.

135
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,200
Okay, four pound signs.
That's a biggie. That's good.

136
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,800
It's a little out of town.

137
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,560
And some kind of play test deal
for a company called Saitoo...

138
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,600
Saitogoo...

139
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,240
-SaitoGemu?
-SaitoGemu. Yeah.

140
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
They're huge.

141
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,840
-They're really big.
-Really?

142
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,600
-Horror games?
-Uh...

143
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
Have you heard of...
Oh, what's one of theirs?

144
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
-<i>Harlech Shadow.</i>
-<i>Harlech Shadow?</i> Yes, I have.

145
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,920
I used to play that in my buddy
David Ludwig's basement

146
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
when we were, like, seventh grade.

147
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,360
Well, that's Shou Saito. It's his company.

148
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,040
-He's like this genius, super secretive.
-Okay.

149
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,280
And apparently,
they're working on this new project.

150
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,160
Big money involved. Groundbreaking.
But nobody knows anything about it.

151
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,120
Well, maybe if I play my cards right
I can get you an exclusive with Shou.

152
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,160
Hmm? Fo Shou? Yeah?

153
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,840
You should take a photo.

154
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,080
Seriously, if you get a photo
of anything that they're working on,

155
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,200
that's a fuckload more money
than four pound signs.

156
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,080
Cool.

157
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,640
Well, where is this place?

158
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,600
Mr. Copper.

159
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,520
Oh, hi. Um... Just Cooper.

160
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Mr. Cooper, I apologize.

161
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,960
Just Cooper is fine.

162
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,120
Then, in that case, I'm just Katie.

163
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

164
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,360
-Follow me.
-Oh, yeah.

165
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,480
-I'll just get my pack here.
-Rav will take care of that.

166
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,160
Oh, Rav will take care of that.
Okay, great.

167
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,240
That's good.
I don't wanna carry it anyway.

168
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,840
Rav kind of reminds me
of like an end-of-level boss.

169
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,160
You know,<i> haiukon.</i> Just...

170
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,600
-How was your journey?
-Great. Thanks.

171
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,880
-The car pick you up okay?
-Yeah.

172
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,080
Wow.

173
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,760
This way.

174
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:16,720
Are they... seeing? It's cool. Very cool.

175
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,160
Wow.

176
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
Come on.

177
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,600
Feel like I'm gonna go meet Dumbledore.
Hope I get Gryffindor.

178
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm gonna need your phone and anything
else you might use to send and receive.

179
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,640
-A little paranoid, don't you think?
-Can't be too careful.

180
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,400
Okay, there you go.

181
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,960
Wow, you really are paranoid.
Whoa!

182
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,640
It's white.

183
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,280
Um...

184
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,640
Okay, so I'm guessing this says, like,
I agree to have my kidneys harvested?

185
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,320
Actually, it's a pretty standard
NDA-disclaimer thing.

186
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,600
Okay.

187
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,000
It's important that you realize there
is a small medical procedure involved.

188
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,040
Sorry, for a game?

189
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,640
Nothing permanent
and we don't harvest your kidneys,

190
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,120
-I promise.
-Okay.

191
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,160
It's no more invasive
than having your ears pierced.

192
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,000
"Confidential information, brain downloads
the game, duration, termination..."

193
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,960
Um... The signature page...

194
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,720
-Where do I sign?
-Oh.

195
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,440
-Signature. Yeah.
-There's a page missing.

196
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,440
-Okay.
-Just a moment.

197
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,040
Alright. I'll just wait... here.

198
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,360
What the fuck?

199
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,560
-All good?
-All good.

200
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,600
What we're working on is an interactive
augmented reality system.

201
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,040
-Like VR?
-More like layers on top of reality.

202
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,320
Oh.

203
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Okay. Um...

204
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,440
Ow.

205
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,320
Um...

206
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,320
-What's that?
-We call this a mushroom.

207
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
-Like <i>Mario Brothers</i>?
-If you like.

208
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,600
-You're qualified to do this, right?
-I haven't killed anyone yet.

209
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,920
May I?

210
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,560
Yeah.

211
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,800
All done.

212
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,520
-That was it?
-See, I told you I'm good.

213
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,440
-No, don't worry, it's not permanent.
-Um...

214
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,120
Okay. What is this, like, some kind of
memory test or something like that?

215
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
-You'll find out.
-Oh, okay.

216
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,160
You might feel a slight twinge
as it initializes.

217
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, okay.

218
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,080
Commencing at 5:38.

219
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,280
-You ready?
-Yes, sir!

220
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,040
Nearly there.

221
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,360
I thought I turned that off.

222
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,040
-All done. You feel okay?
-Uh-huh.

223
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,240
Feel great.

224
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,480
-Watch the targets.
-Okay.

225
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,200
Um...

226
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,840
Is--

227
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,920
What do you see?

228
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,240
Like a-- um--

229
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,600
Like a video game gopher.

230
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,120
-Is it more detailed now?
-Yeah.

231
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,040
Yep, yeah.

232
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,800
-And now?
-Holy fuck!

233
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,680
Holy shit! He-- Fuck. He's right--

234
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,240
He's right-- He's right-- Can I--

235
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,800
Whoo!

236
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,000
<i>He's not real.</i>
<i>He's a sort of mental projection.</i>

237
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
<i>-You can see him. I can't.</i>
<i>-You can't?</i>

238
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,800
Wow! Oh, okay.

239
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
Give him a whack.

240
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:09,680
Give him a whack? Oh. Okay, alright.

241
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,360
Okay! Alright, so just like whack-a-mole.

242
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,440
-Mm-hmm.
-I've played it a million times. Okay.

243
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
Alright.

244
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,000
Here we go. Come on up.

245
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,840
Oh! Where you coming up?

246
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,240
No. No.

247
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,680
No.

248
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,920
Oh!

249
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
Oh!

250
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,440
Alright. Stay down.

251
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh! Okay.

252
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:55,360
Good game. Very good game.
You are so adorable.

253
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,280
Okay, bye. Bye.

254
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,240
-Is that it?
-Afraid so.

255
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,400
Oh.

256
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,600
Now, were the gophers
two-dimensional or three?

257
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,280
Three.
No, no, no. 3D, super 3D. Like-- Yeah.

258
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,680
-Now this is just a limited test demo.
-That was a demo?

259
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,800
I think you should beta test
the full experience we're working on.

260
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,640
There'd be more money in it, of course.
If you're game?

261
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh-huh, I'm game. I'm game.

262
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,880
- This is Shou Saito.
- Oh!

263
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,920
-You must be our latest volunteer.
-Hi.

264
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,200
This is really great. Hi.

265
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,760
Hi.

266
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,400
I just-- I wanted to say
that the mole game, super fun.

267
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,080
Super fun... fun.

268
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,360
-Fun?
-Fun.

269
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,080
-Fun is good.
-Yeah. Oh.

270
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,040
-Playing games is good.
-Mm.

271
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,840
Your heart goes faster.

272
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,040
-You smile.
-Yeah.

273
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,480
Yeah. Or, um... scream.

274
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,240
Oh!

275
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,400
I have always liked
to make the player jump.

276
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,200
Frightened. You get scared, you jump.

277
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,400
-Afterwards, you feel good.
-Yeah.

278
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,600
You glow.

279
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,520
Why?

280
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,200
Oh, um...

281
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,640
Because of the adrenaline rush.

282
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,800
-Yes.
-Yeah.

283
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,120
But mostly because you are still alive.

284
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,840
You have faced your greatest fears
in a safe environment.

285
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:39,120
It is a release of fear. It liberates you.

286
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,200
Yeah. I mean, totally.

287
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,920
What we are working on now

288
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,600
is the most personal
survival horror game in history.

289
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,200
Cool.

290
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,760
One that works out how to scare you
by using your own mind.

291
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,200
Whoa. That-- That sounds crazy.

292
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,160
Can't wait!

293
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:04,040
I'm uploading a neural net package.

294
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,840
Neural net packing, neural net. Hmm.

295
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,880
Name could use a little work, I think.
It's all 90s.

296
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,160
I'm just kidding, it's a good name.

297
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,160
It's state of the art
intelligence software.

298
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,280
It learns and adapts on the fly.
It'll monitor your brain activity

299
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,320
and try and work out how best
to frighten you

300
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,800
and then adjust
to your experience accordingly.

301
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,680
-Whoa!

302
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,280
-Are you ready?
-Oh, yeah.

303
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,520
-Beam me up. Here we go, lock and load.
-Eyes closed.

304
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:33,000
-Time is currently 6:17 p.m.
-Okay.

305
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,080
It's uploading.
Five, four, three, two, one.

306
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,640
How are you feeling?

307
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,200
Um...

308
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,480
I feel good. I feel normal.

309
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,080
Okay. Stand up, slowly.

310
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,600
Are you ready to play?

311
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,720
Isn't this the <i>Harlech Shadow</i> house?

312
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,160
It's part of the estate.

313
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:40,760
The gamekeeper's lodge, actually.
But, yeah, this was the model.

314
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,360
The layout was replicated for the game
and the texture scanned.

315
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,120
Wow!

316
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Very, very cool.

317
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,800
So what's the game, what do I do?

318
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,880
You don't have to do anything.

319
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,480
You just stay in here alone,

320
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,240
see how long you last
until you're too scared to continue.

321
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,600
So all I have to do is,
like, stay here?

322
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,880
And I get paid for that?

323
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,600
I'll be back in the control room,
watching.

324
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,160
There are cameras all over,
so no stealing the silverware.

325
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,840
And now there's this.

326
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,000
-And what's this?
-It's an earpiece.

327
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,240
Oh!

328
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,000
Yeah, just pop it in, and you and I
will be in contact the whole time.

329
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,360
Oh, cool.

330
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,480
And I can, like, talk to you,
and you'll hear it? Great, that's great.

331
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,720
Now, nothing you'll see
can physically harm you.

332
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,240
It's all just audio-visual,
like the gopher game.

333
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Oh, okay.

334
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,480
But if it does get too intense,
we can pull you out at any time

335
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,720
-and stop the experiment.
-Okay.

336
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,560
Is there a safe word you can think of?

337
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,000
Something easy to remember in distress?

338
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,280
How about the word "stop"?

339
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,520
-Good choice. "Stop" it is.
-Yeah.

340
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,520
Okay, we'll leave you
to enjoy your evening.

341
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,800
-Alright.
-You'll hear from me in a moment.

342
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,360
Just make yourself at home.

343
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,440
Okay, all right. Well, take her easy.

344
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,200
<i>Harlech... Shadow.</i>

345
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,160
Is this real? Yeah, it's real.
That's real. It's really dead.

346
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,120
- <i> Cooper.</i>
- Oh, hey.

347
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,920
<i>-Are you hearing me?</i>
-Loud and clear.

348
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Oh!

349
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,880
<i>Reaching for the Dutch courage already,</i>
<i>I see.</i>

350
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,200
<i>-I'm afraid that wine's non-alcoholic.</i>
-Lame.

351
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:24,320
<i>-Well, we need you with a clear head.</i>
-Okay. Fair point. Fair point.

352
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,440
This is high-quality craftsmanship.
This is nice.

353
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,920
Yeah. It's good woodwork.

354
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,160
-That's this place.
<i>-Full marks for observation.</i>

355
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,920
Mm-hmm! Yep!

356
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,360
Alright, there we go.

357
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,960
Ah!

358
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,800
-Oh, shit.
<i>-What's up?</i>

359
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,400
I just forgot I don't have my phone.

360
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,280
I keep going for it,
I forget it's not in my pocket.

361
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
And there's, uh... no TV here, so...

362
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:56,560
<i>Welcome to the 19th century.</i>
<i>No TV, no Internet, no wi-fi.</i>

363
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,120
Yeah. No wonder people were seeing shit.

364
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,320
Probably were just bored out
of their gourds.

365
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,880
<i>Well, that's the leading theory</i>
<i>about ghost sightings.</i>

366
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,080
<i>The mind plays tricks</i>
<i>when less stimulated.</i>

367
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,360
<i>Fewer distractions,</i>
<i>people saw more ghosts.</i>

368
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,040
Isn't that a nice piece of info?

369
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,960
Well, they got literature, though.

370
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,000
That's pretty sweet, right?

371
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,600
Oh, my God, I can't remember the actual
last time that I read a book.

372
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,160
<i>To think people used to do this</i>
<i>on purpose.</i>

373
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,040
I know. Crazy. Why?

374
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,960
<i>-You know, I don't think I've--</i>
-Shh, alright?

375
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,040
I need to get into some old-school
shit here. Concentrate.

376
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,680
<i> Pardon me.</i>

377
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,840
<i>Can I point out your heart rate</i>
<i>just increased?</i>

378
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,480
Yeah. Well, it should have
cos there's a huge crazy spider.

379
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,040
<i>You see a spider?</i>

380
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,800
<i>-You don't-- you don't see that?</i>
-No.

381
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Don't-- Don't walk. Don't--

382
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Holy shit!

383
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,520
<i>Tough guy like you, scared of spiders.</i>

384
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,040
Yeah, I'm just not fond of them.

385
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,520
<i>It's worked out you're</i>
<i>an arachnophobe quickly.</i>

386
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,640
<i>It's probing for weak spots.</i>

387
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,640
God damn it.

388
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,800
Fucker!

389
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,120
Yeah!

390
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,840
Um...

391
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,880
Okay.

392
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,680
Yeah, well, yeah.

393
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:44,360
Whole lot more realistic
than the gopher game.

394
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,000
It's good. It's good graphics.

395
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,000
It's good, uh-- Yeah.

396
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,560
Weak sauce.

397
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
<i>-What is it?</i>
-Just--

398
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,280
Nothing. Nothing.

399
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,160
Here with the figures. There's a--
No. There's a light on...

400
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,240
now, in the...

401
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,800
Can you... zoom in and--
zoom in on it?

402
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,200
And you can see what I'm talking about.
Whoa!

403
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,160
-<i>Cooper...</i>
-And now there's-- Shh!

404
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,600
There's a guy in the window.
That wasn't...

405
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,440
Yeah.

406
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,080
And now he's gone.
Now nobody's in the window.

407
00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:00,280
Which is the--

408
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,920
Mm-hmm.

409
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,760
Yeah, there's a--

410
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,120
Just leaky pipes.

411
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:26,000
I knew it. It was leaky pipes, like--

412
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,000
Holy fuck!

413
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,080
Fuck!

414
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,280
Oh! Oh!

415
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,160
Okay.

416
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,000
That got me. You got me.

417
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,320
<i>- What are you seeing?</i>

418
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,920
Like a creepy fucking guy.

419
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,880
Wow, just...

420
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

421
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,960
He kinda looks like Josh Peters.

422
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,320
-It's Josh Peters! You're Josh Peters!
<i>-Sorry?</i>

423
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,880
You're Josh Peters from high school!
From a guy I know at high school.

424
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,320
<i>The system could be mining some</i>
<i>of your personal memories for texture.</i>

425
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,880
<i>Was Josh Peters</i>
<i>someone you were scared of?</i>

426
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,520
He was a bully. I wasn't scared.

427
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,640
I wasn't scared of him,
but he was a bully and--

428
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,080
Man! Take a couple of Krav Maga classes
and I'd be ready.

429
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,080
I'd be ready!

430
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,440
<i>Kali ma! </i>Dah!

431
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.

432
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,120
I'd offer you some, but I don't think
you can drink it so...

433
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,880
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

434
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,920
Catch ya later, Peters.

435
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,240
This non-alcoholic wine is pretty good.

436
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:59,240
I'm not like a expert or anything,
but it's kinda great.

437
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,360
I was in France.
I stayed at this, like, vineyard,

438
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,960
and they had this wine,
like, grape-stomping festival.

439
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,720
Now that,
that wine was good. I know that.

440
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,720
<i>You're being discursive.</i>

441
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,840
-What is discursive? Discursive?
<i>-Talkative.</i>

442
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,400
-Mm-hmm.
<i>-Rambling.</i>

443
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,840
Is that a problem?

444
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,600
<i>People sometimes talk more</i>
<i>when they're afraid.</i>

445
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,880
<i>Helps compensate for the fear.</i>

446
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,520
<i>-Masks it, too.</i>
-Oh, yeah?

447
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,600
<i>Similar to when you've got the TV on</i>
<i>late at night.</i>

448
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,840
<i>The voices make you feel less alone.</i>

449
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,640
<i>Even though you are alone.</i>

450
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,920
You aren't scaring me, Katie.

451
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,000
<i>Pity.</i>

452
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,880
Is there like a refrigerator here?

453
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,560
<i>- There's some snacks in the cupboard.</i>

454
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,680
Alrighty. Eenie meenie, miney...

455
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,520
Mo! Alright.

456
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,080
Okay, ginger snaps.

457
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,240
Let's see.

458
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This'll do.

459
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,640
Now... um...

460
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,480
He's gonna be right behind this door
when I close it, isn't he?

461
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,880
Yeah, that's how this works.

462
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,440
Knew it. Jump scares get pretty old--

463
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,960
Fuck!

464
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,640
Oh, God.

465
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,520
<i>-What the hell is that?</i>
-What do you see?

466
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,280
Holy shit!

467
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,280
A fucking-- Uh...

468
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,360
Hard to explain.

469
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,160
It's like a huge-ass spider with a face
and dicks coming out of his mouth.

470
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,600
It's...

471
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,600
Peters. Peters is inside.

472
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,280
Like a Peters-spider mash-up.

473
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,760
Ah, Katie!
Are you doing this, or is this fucking me?

474
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,320
<i>- I think that's all you.</i>
- I'm so fucked up!

475
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,640
<i>God! Fuck!</i>

476
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,200
Holy shit, you're fucking gross.

477
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,440
Yeah--

478
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,120
Sorry, can you say again?

479
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,640
Katie, hello?

480
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,560
Damn it, Katie!

481
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,640
Whenever you come back online,
just say the word.

482
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,840
No, I'm not scared, just... bored.

483
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,560
That you guys?

484
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,080
Coming to fix the earpiece?
That's probably a good idea.

485
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,640
Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,400
Fuck it, man!

487
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,000
Come on!

488
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,960
You're in danger.

489
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,960
Sonja?

490
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,920
Now we're talking.
Alright, this is incredible.

491
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,240
This-- very impressive.
I am thoroughly impressed.

492
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:39,200
I am-- Wow! Wow!

493
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,840
You look so real.
You're, like, just like her.

494
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,480
I mean, wow.

495
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:51,400
Except... you're just unfortunately not...
um...

496
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,200
-Cooper, what are you doing?
-Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

497
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,400
-Cooper, you're in danger.
-Shh! Quiet. Quiet! I need to think.

498
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:01,120
You're fucking real.
You are real. You're real.

499
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
-Cooper, you're in--
-You're Sonja. You're actually here.

500
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,680
-Are you actually here right now?
-I'm real. I'm actually here.

501
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,120
-God.
-And we have to go.

502
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,920
-You have to listen to me.
-How are you here?

503
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,840
You know that photo that you sent me?

504
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,280
I dug around and apparently
Shou Saito took out a patent

505
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,800
for a computer brain interface last year.

506
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,880
How are you real? I don't--

507
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,720
Okay, fuck. I don't--

508
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,800
They brought you here!

509
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,440
You are, you're real,
and they brought you here,

510
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,080
and they're trying to fuck with me.
Nice try, good try.

511
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,640
I get it. It's part of the test.

512
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,120
His patent got rejected outright.
They said it was insane, it was dangerous.

513
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:42,120
Wow. Really? How much are they paying you?
Honestly. Cos you're killing it right now.

514
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,080
-Have they given you something?
-Sorry, I thought you were fake.

515
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,600
But now I know you're real,
I'm being a really terrible host.

516
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,080
I got some non-alcoholic wine.
Might put us in the mood.

517
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,680
-Cooper, what I want to do is--
-We'll talk about it in the kitchen.

518
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,720
-Cooper!
-Sonja, relax, okay?

519
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,840
Give it up.
I know, the jig's up, okay? Let it go.

520
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,120
Look, Cooper, there's more.

521
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,520
Five people have disappeared
in the past year.

522
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,920
All tourists, all registered
with that stupid odd jobs app.

523
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,920
Oh, yeah? Wow. God, that's crazy.

524
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,680
Whatever they're doing to you,
whatever they've done to you,

525
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,920
it's dangerous,
and we really have to go now, Cooper.

526
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,040
Okay, okay. Alright.

527
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,880
-Well, if your story's true...
-Cooper.

528
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,440
-then how'd you find me?
-What?

529
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,800
How'd you know where I am?

530
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,600
It's a games company,
I looked up the address.

531
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,080
Yeah, really?

532
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,480
No, no, no, no.
How'd you find me here? This place.

533
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,200
-I tracked you.
-You tracked me?

534
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,280
Yeah, with your GPS on your phone.
Find My Friends.

535
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,040
Find My Friends? That would've worked,
but they took my phone.

536
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:51,640
And it's in a building, like, a mile away.
So, yeah, nice try.

537
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,920
That's right.

538
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,240
So much for women outsmarting men.
Singularity <i>that!</i>

539
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,320
Look, all I'm saying is that

540
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,880
I think that you could've come up
with a better story,

541
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,160
it could have been funny or...

542
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,160
Okay, alright, don't be pissed.

543
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,920
Do you ever wonder
how your bank account got hacked?

544
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,840
What are you doing?

545
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,240
-I cloned your card as you were asleep.
-Whoa. Okay.

546
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,400
Put the knife down.
What are you going to do with that?

547
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,840
I drew your attention to this job.

548
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,000
Sonja, put the fucking knife down, okay?
It's not funny.

549
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,600
Should've called your mum, Cooper.

550
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,840
-But you called me, and I led you here...
-Sonja.

551
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,600
-You know what?
-...like a breadcrumb trail.

552
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:39,120
Put the knife down. Drop the act.
Okay, seriously, drop the knife, Sonja.

553
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,080
It's not fucking funny. Put the knife--

554
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,760
This isn't what I signed up for.
I'm fucking done, okay?

555
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,960
Fuck!

556
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,920
What the fuck?

557
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Oh, fuck! Oh!

558
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,840
Holy fuck!

559
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,640
Stop!

560
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,640
Fuck!

561
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:23,040
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!

562
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,720
- <i> Cooper.</i>
- Katie!

563
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,120
<i>-Katie!</i>
-Cooper.

564
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,440
<i>-Katie!</i>
-Cooper, what's happening?

565
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,600
What the fuck happened?

566
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
<i>What's happening? We've been talking.</i>
<i>You've not been responding.</i>

567
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,000
-You said I wouldn't feel anything!
<i>-What are you seeing? What's there?</i>

568
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,120
-Fuck! She's gone now.
<i>-Who's gone?</i>

569
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,960
Oh, my God, I-I felt it.

570
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,640
There's a knife in my arm!

571
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,640
-In my shoulder.
<i>-Cooper, who was there?</i>

572
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,880
-Fuck... Sonja.
<i>-Who?</i>

573
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,200
Sonja. She's this girl that I know,
that fucking-- She stabbed me.

574
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,320
-She had a fucking knife.
<i>-Nothing can harm you, Cooper.</i>

575
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,520
-No, no, no, no. She was solid.
<i>-No, she can't have been.</i>

576
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:26,000
She-- I was stabbed! I would know!

577
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,560
<i>Nothing you see can harm</i>
<i>or even touch you.</i>

578
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,320
<i>It's purely audio-visual.</i>

579
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,640
<i>-There's no physical sensation.</i>
-Fuck! Yes, there was!

580
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:39,000
<i>-Cooper, you need to calm down.</i>
-I know because I felt it, okay?

581
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,200
I felt her arm, it was warm,

582
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,440
and I felt her fucking stab me
in the shoulder.

583
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,720
<i>- That's not possible.</i>
- Oh, my God.

584
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,960
<i>-It's not possible, Cooper.</i>
-Yeah, it is! Yeah, it is!

585
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,120
<i>Physical sensations shouldn't be possible.</i>

586
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,000
<i>-Unless, I mean...</i>
-Oh, God. Unless what?

587
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,040
<i>I don't know. The neuron net,</i>
<i>it could have maybe worked out</i>

588
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,600
<i>some means</i>
<i>of replicating physical experiences,</i>

589
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,800
<i>-but that would be unprecedented.</i>
-Jesus Christ.

590
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,960
Okay, you know what? Stop the game.

591
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,440
I want out. Just pull me out now.

592
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,680
Stop, stop, stop.
Safe word. Fucking stop!

593
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,640
<i>-Okay, okay, just let us work it out.</i>
-Oh, God.

594
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,760
No, I want this fucking thing out now.

595
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,240
<i>Cooper,</i>
<i>do not attempt to remove that yourself.</i>

596
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,160
Removing it yourself
is extremely dangerous.

597
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,040
Stop that, that could kill you!

598
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,240
Just stay calm!

599
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,360
Is that Shou?

600
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,120
Is that Shou? What's he saying?
What's he saying?

601
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,760
<i>Okay, Cooper.</i>
<i>We're gonna commence with deactivation.</i>

602
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,520
Oh, that's great news.

603
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,560
<i>We need you to follow instructions</i>
<i>and make it to the access point.</i>

604
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,880
The access point? Great.
Where the fuck's the access point?

605
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,520
-Oh, fuck! More stairs? Come on!
<i>-Just one more level.</i>

606
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:54,720
<i>- Trust me.</i>
- Okay.

607
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,600
<i>- Left at the top.</i>

608
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,200
-Okay, which door?
-<i>Room at the end.</i>

609
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,880
<i>What is it?</i>

610
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,520
There's gonna be something behind there.
I can feel it.

611
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:13,600
-Something like...
<i>-Like what?</i>

612
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,120
Some personal fucked-up shit.

613
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,480
Like... I don't know, I could feel it
digging around in my head.

614
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,320
<i>Cooper, get to the door.</i>

615
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,320
It's gonna be like my mum,
I don't know, dead.

616
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,560
<i>-Your mum?</i>
-Fucking swinging from a fucking beam.

617
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,360
<i>-Your mother is not in there.</i>
-You're not in control of this!

618
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:36,160
It's in my head.
It fucking knows. It knows.

619
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,440
-It knows!
<i>-It knows what?</i>

620
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,600
It knows I got this thing with my mum.

621
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,440
<i>Cooper, I promise you, she's not in there.</i>

622
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,720
<i>-Now open the door.</i>
-Oh, my God.

623
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,880
<i>It's the only way I can get you out.</i>
<i>Listen to me.</i>

624
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,200
Okay, Okay. Fuck. Okay.

625
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,040
<i>Whatever's in there cannot harm you.</i>

626
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:59,000
<i>But I can't get you out</i>
<i>unless you open that door, Cooper.</i>

627
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,000
Okay.

628
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,920
<i>Would you kindly open the door?</i>

629
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,640
Here we go. Here we go.

630
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,760
Okay.

631
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,880
Okay, okay, I'm in the room.
Where's the access point?

632
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,880
<i>Access point?</i>

633
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,880
<i>-There is no access point.</i>
-What?

634
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,920
<i>I'm fucking with you, Cooper.</i>

635
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,600
<i>I told you to come up here</i>
<i>to see if we've broken you enough</i>

636
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,200
<i>to obey instructions without question.</i>

637
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,760
<i>-And we have.</i>
-Oh, no, no, no.

638
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,280
Katie, come on.
Katie, come on, let me out!

639
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,240
Katie, let me out, come on!
What the fuck!

640
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,840
Oh, what are you gonna do?
Oh, what are you doing to me?

641
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,520
-Why are you doing this?
<i>-You thought you'd see your mother.</i>

642
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,760
-Oh, fuck!
<i>-What does she look like?</i>

643
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,880
<i>Your mother, can you describe her face?</i>

644
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,760
<i>Her hair colour?</i>

645
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,240
She--

646
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,440
<i>Is she tall, short, fat, thin?</i>

647
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:17,400
<i>-Where did you grow up?</i>
-She--

648
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,080
<i>What's your favourite band?</i>
<i>Your favourite flavour ice cream?</i>

649
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,400
<i>The name of the girl who stabbed you?</i>

650
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,040
<i>You don't know any of these things,</i>
<i>do you?</i>

651
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:27,560
<i>Don't you think that's odd?</i>

652
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,880
It's fucking taking my memories!

653
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,320
<i>Overwriting them, technically.</i>

654
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,240
Fuck.

655
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,160
<i>Look in the mirror behind you.</i>

656
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,720
<i>Do you recognize yourself?</i>

657
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,000
<i>Do you even know who you're looking at?</i>

658
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,000
<i>Soon you won't be anything.</i>
<i>You'll be just like your dad.</i>

659
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,840
Shut up, shut up, shut up.

660
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,520
<i>-That's what really scares you, isn't it?</i>
-Stop it.

661
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,320
-Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
<i>-You're going the same place he did.</i>

662
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:01,040
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

663
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:03,960
<i>-You're going nowhere.</i>
-Shut up! Shut up.

664
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:08,400
<i> You should have called mum.</i>
<i>She's all that's left.</i>

665
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,440
<i>-You abandoned her.</i>
-No, no, no, no!

666
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,400
Get out of my head!

667
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,960
<i>You'll never see her again.</i>
<i>You'll never speak to her again.</i>

668
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,720
<i>-Never see her face.</i>
-Get out of my fucking head!

669
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,280
Get out of my fucking head!
Get out of my fucking head!

670
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,680
<i>You're a bad son.</i>
<i>You'll never see your mother again.</i>

671
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,800
<i>- You're going nowhere.</i>

672
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,120
<i>Straight into oblivion.</i>

673
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,520
<i>You deserve it.</i>
<i>You should have called her.</i>

674
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,640
Get out of my fucking head!

675
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:43,400
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

676
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,880
Get it out of my fucking head!

677
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,560
Cooper, I'm gonna shut it off, okay?
I just need to connect.

678
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,960
Get it out of my head!

679
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,720
Get it out of my head!
Get it out of my head!

680
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:57,320
Oh, my God. Where am I?

681
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,080
Who are you?

682
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,800
I can't stop it.

683
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,680
I don't know who I am.
So I-- So I need to go home.

684
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:17,640
The interface has data tendrils
like roots.

685
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,320
They've dug in deeper
than they're meant to.

686
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:25,440
Threaded through your brain,
taken over whole areas, I can't stop it.

687
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,560
I can't remove it, and I can't stop it.

688
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,200
But I-- But I don't know who I am.

689
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:38,520
I don't know-- I don't know who I am.

690
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,240
I don't know who I am.

691
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,520
I don't know.

692
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:50,400
On behalf of Saito Game Team,
I most humbly apologize.

693
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,760
Who are you?
What have you done to me?

694
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:02,200
-What have you done to me?
-Put him with the others, please.

695
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,560
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!

696
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,880
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Stop, stop, stop!

697
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:11,280
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
No, don't, don't!

698
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:15,400
Don't! Don't!

699
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,600
Stop! Stop!

700
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,520
No!

701
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,880
Oh, fuck.

702
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,080
That was one second.

703
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:34,520
Either he's super susceptible to this
or the software is way too powerful still.

704
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,920
It's jumped from zero to 18K
in five milliseconds...

705
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:44,360
<i>I'm sorry. The experience was</i>
<i>more powerful than intended, Mr. Cooper.</i>

706
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,480
<i>I hope you can forgive us.</i>

707
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,840
<i> ...all luggage under the seat</i>
<i>in front of you.</i>

708
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:03,560
<i>All electronic devices</i>
<i>should now be turned off and stowed</i>

709
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,400
<i>as they may interfere with the aircraft's</i>
<i>navigational and communication....</i>

710
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,360
Mum?

711
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,000
Mum?

712
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,520
I have to call him.

713
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,640
Mum?

714
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,400
Why did Cooper go?

715
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,640
-I--
-Mom, I'm right here. I'm--

716
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,960
-I'm right here, Mum.
-I have to call Cooper.

717
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,800
I have to call
and make sure that he's safe.

718
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,840
I have to call him. I have to call him.
I have to call him.

719
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,800
Mum?

720
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,720
Mum!

721
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:08,200
Mum! Mum! Mum! Mum!

722
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:27,800
-What happened?
-His phone rang.

723
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,400
-You didn't take it off him?
-Yes, but...

724
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,440
-The signals interfere.
-I know I switched it off.

725
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,520
Maybe he did something
while I was out of the room.

726
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:41,400
An oversight. Won't happen again.

727
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,560
The incoming signal must have interfered
with the upload sequence.

728
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,720
Every synapse in his brain lit up at once.

729
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,160
Then went dead. Like that.

730
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,760
You said he shouted something.
What was it?

731
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
"Mum."

732
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:11,040
-Make a note of that.
-Yes.
