1
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,280
Kenny?
Big spillage on table four. Sorry.

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,120
Okay. All right.

3
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,560
Excuse me.

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,960
Someone forgot this.

5
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,480
Oh, thank you!

6
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,200
-What do you say?
-Thank you.

7
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,360
-It's all right.
-She forgets everything. Thanks again.

8
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,760
She was some yoga teacher, proper bendy.
Look. Look.

9
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,640
Jesus! Fuck!
What, she sent that to you, did she?

10
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,880
Double naughty.

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,040
Jog on.

12
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,200
Linds!

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
Linds, where's my laptop?

14
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,360
-Don't be a bell end!
-Use your own.

15
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,880
-Mine's bust. Yours has gone all frozen.
-What did you do?

16
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,040
-I was trying to put on this film thing.
-What film thing?

17
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,040
Don't know. Some programme
lets you watch free films.

18
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,280
While I was trying to put it on,
then it locked up.

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,800
-Look, it's not my fault.
-Don't take it again. It's not yours.

20
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,840
-Oh, fix mine when you've done that.
-"Fix mine when you've done that."

21
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,800
- Stop nicking my Cokes!
- Whatever.

22
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,880
Did you draw that yourself, Kenny?

23
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,320
Thanks, Kenny. See you tomorrow.

24
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,680
Bye.

25
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,360
- Bye, Kenny.
- Bye, Kenny, I'll see you tomorrow.

26
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
You're mental.

27
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,520
-You're mental.
-You're a thief.

28
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:30,200
Love? Kenny? What do you think?

29
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,680
- I'm still not used to the colour.
- It's nice.

30
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,920
Yeah?

31
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,160
Do me a favour
and prison-guard your sister, will you?

32
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,840
I won't be late. Probably.

33
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,680
Oh, my God! He's outside.
There's a lasagna thing in the freezer.

34
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,960
I love you.

35
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,760
Have you seen my keys?

36
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,240
You okay, Ken? Love?

37
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
Yeah, fine.

38
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
Ha!

39
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,000
-Morning, Kenny.
-Hi.

40
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,440
-Kenny?
-Feeling really sick.

41
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,440
-You've only just got here.
-I know but think I might throw up.

42
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay, just next time can you-- ?

43
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,520
Whoa! Easy, knobber.

44
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Come on.

45
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,640
-It's fragile.
-What is it?

46
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,760
They told me to do that.

47
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,720
Is that it? What do I do now?

48
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,240
I can't really help you.

49
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,960
What do I have to do?

50
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,720
Just whatever they say
and once you've done that, you're out.

51
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,480
They let you off.

52
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,200
Hello?

53
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,680
Del-- Delivery.

54
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,560
Wrong room.

55
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,440
They said 121.

56
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,240
No, there's no delivery here.

57
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,760
- But they said--
- I haven't ordered anything.

58
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,200
It's a cake.

59
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,640
- What cake?
- I don't know. I think it's a sponge.

60
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,040
I didn't order a cake
so just take it back to the bakery

61
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,080
-and tell them they got it wrong.
-Look, if I--

62
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,520
I don't want the cake.
So go away or I call the front desk.

63
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,280
I will kick that cake
up your fucking arse.

64
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,360
M-Mindy sent me.

65
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,720
-What is this? Where's Mindy?
-I was just told to give this to you.

66
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,600
-Mindy told you?
-No.

67
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,920
-You said "Mindy."
-That's what they told me to say.

68
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,200
Get inside.

69
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,640
So what are you saying?
Are you saying Mindy ordered the cake?

70
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,000
No, uh, I don't know.
It-- they-- it was them.

71
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,520
Them? They? Who the fuck are you on about?

72
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
-The people.
-What fucking people?

73
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,040
The phone people.
The people on the phone.

74
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,480
They told me to bring the cake,
and they're leaving texts on my phone,

75
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,160
-and then I do what they say.
-Whoa, whoa. Slow down.

76
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,920
Just breathe through your nose.

77
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,640
Through your nose. Okay?

78
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,440
Good. Now, just show me what they said.
On your phone.

79
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:54,240
-Show me the text.
-Okay, well, um... This.

80
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,240
-I should--
-Shut up. Just let me.

81
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,720
What the fuck is this?

82
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,040
-Who are these people?
-I don't know.

83
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,800
-Who are you?
-I'm not them.

84
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,200
They send me messages,
and I do what they say.

85
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,680
Why? Why would you do that?

86
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,200
Is it them?

87
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
-They said I had to do that.
-Jesus Christ!

88
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,480
Okay, okay.

89
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,640
They're saying they just need us
to follow their instructions,

90
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,840
and everything will be okay. Okay?

91
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,640
Shit!

92
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,120
They're saying we have to do it
together.

93
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,280
-What do we have to do?
-Just take the cake somewhere.

94
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,200
They sent me an address.
A map coordinate thing.

95
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,760
-And there's a car we need to get.
-A car? What sort of car?

96
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:24,440
I don't know what sort of car.
They said it's in the car park outside.

97
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,880
They sent me a licence plate.
That's all I know.

98
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,600
Why both of us?

99
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,440
I don't know!

100
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,040
Just let me deal
with my fucking shoe, please.

101
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,280
What have they said?

102
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,280
They say, "Go with him. Take the package."

103
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,840
Okay.

104
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,440
"V760 DHM."

105
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,680
V760 DHM.

106
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm getting fucking number blindness here.

107
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,680
That's it.

108
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:23,600
All right. They said
the keys are on the back. Okay.

109
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,720
Look, maybe you better drive.
Do you drive?

110
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:37,240
-I mean, I had a drink back there.
-I can't. I can-- I can drive.

111
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,720
I'm still learning.
Haven't passed my test yet.

112
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,920
All right. Uh... You're navigating.

113
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,320
Okay, you've got a sat nav
on your phone?

114
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,560
Yep.

115
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,960
Here it is. Punch that in.

116
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,400
It's a street somewhere out of town.
Sort of High Wycombe-ish.

117
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,840
They said we got to be there by two.
It's gonna be tight.

118
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:11,320
So I'm guessing they got some shit on you
that they're threatening to put out?

119
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:19,880
With me, it's...

120
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,800
You saw the room, fucking lacy knickers.

121
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,320
I was waiting for a prostitute.

122
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,760
Escort, hooker,
whatever they call them now.

123
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,040
I got a family, which is great.

124
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,680
You get bored.

125
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,000
I mean, when I was young,
I used to like...

126
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,960
I can't fucking justify it.
I just wanted to fuck a 20-something.

127
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,000
For old times' sake, I don't know.

128
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,720
I joined this website. I was curious.
Just wanted to see what was on there.

129
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,040
I got talking to Mindy,
who I thought was Mindy.

130
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,160
I mean, she sent me pictures.
I sent some back.

131
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,320
Phone photos. Grabbing my cock.

132
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,920
You name it.
They got the whole fucking thing.

133
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,560
But not just pictures, chat messages.
All the arrangements, where and when.

134
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,040
Me haggling over the price
and they say they got it all.

135
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,520
Sucked up the whole hard drive
like an audit.

136
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,280
Fucking twat. What a fucking idiot!

137
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,440
If that shit gets out,
that's my wife out the door.

138
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,360
Then there's the kids, she'll take them.

139
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,560
Oh, no, not a doubt in my mind
she'd take them and she'd win.

140
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,200
Custody, she'd win.

141
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,920
And I'm not losing my kids.
I tell you that right now.

142
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,520
No way! Absolutely fucking no!

143
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,920
They filmed me.

144
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,400
-Filmed you...
-Through my computer camera.

145
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,800
-What, like, filmed you?
-Yeah, like, you know, doing it.

146
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,200
-Like sex?
-No. Like, you... you know.

147
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,200
Jerking off.
Jerking off to porn or something?

148
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,480
Well, everyone does that.

149
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,280
-The fucking pope probably does that.
-They're gonna put it everywhere.

150
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,040
Like they're gonna send it to everyone.

151
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,920
-Oh, shit the fuck!
-What? What?

152
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,720
-How long's that light been on?
-What light?

153
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,080
Whoever's car this is,
they left it fucking empty.

154
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,920
I won't be a minute.

155
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,480
Unleaded. Unleaded.

156
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Oh, bugger!

157
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,080
Listen, you pay, yeah? It'll save time.

158
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Have you got any money?

159
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,880
Okay, Visa card PIN number 3109.
Say that back to me.

160
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,920
-Visa card--
-Just the number!

161
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,320
-Uh... 3109.
-Okay, go!

162
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,520
Pump four!

163
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,440
-What's your pump number?
-Four.

164
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,560
-You want some chocolate?
-No.

165
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,280
-It's two for one this week.
-I'm okay.

166
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,440
31.89.

167
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,080
Pop your PIN in.

168
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,040
- If you're sure you don't mind?
- No, no, of course not.

169
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,760
-I'll get on to that. Make some calls.
-Brilliant! It's next Wednesday.

170
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,840
-Okay.
-Keep it non-dairy just to be safe.

171
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Okay.

172
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,560
This is, uh...

173
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,280
my nephew.

174
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,800
Nice to meet you.

175
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
-Kenny.
-Kenny. I'm Karen.

176
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,480
We're both Ks.

177
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,520
I'm head of the PTA at Theo
and Cassie's school, for my sins.

178
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,000
Just roped poor Hector into sorting out
the catering for the quiz night.

179
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,640
Been the usual balls up.

180
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,840
Listen, we better get this guy
to the station.

181
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,480
His train's... So we better go.

182
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,280
-Cansroad Station?
-Yeah.

183
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,480
Oh, couldn't drop me
at the end of my road, could you?

184
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,960
It's on the way. Mayer Street?

185
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,440
It's the bus otherwise and that goes
all the way around the common.

186
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:03,840
-We're in a bit of a rush, actually.
-Well, it's no detour. It's en route.

187
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,680
I'll hop out.
Hardly need to slow down. Yeah?

188
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,640
-Yep. Sure. Let's go.
-Brilliant. Thanks!

189
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,360
I'll just get in the back.

190
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,200
Oh, don't want to squash your box.

191
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,200
-What's that? Present?
-It's a cake.

192
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,080
-It's just a-- it's a cake for Penny.
-Oh, lucky her.

193
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,160
So how is Penny?

194
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,400
Haven't seen her since...
must have been sports day.

195
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,760
She's good.

196
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,040
-She still planning to get back to work?
-Yeah. Yep.

197
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,840
- I mean, how old's Theo now?
- Uh... He's seven.

198
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,600
He was so funny in the play.
That big top hat on.

199
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,360
Yeah, he had a good time.

200
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,760
Oh, Anna's having a sleepover.

201
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,200
Cassie's probably already told you
about it.

202
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,080
Six nine-year-olds in the house.
I must be mad!

203
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,040
So, Kenny, where you heading back to?

204
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,120
-Sorry. What?
-Are you going home or...?

205
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,800
-Uh...
-Train. Birmingham.

206
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,880
Yeah. Uh...

207
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,000
-Yeah, I-I live in Birmingham.
-Oh, my husband's from Birmingham.

208
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,600
-What part are you?
-South.

209
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,240
South.

210
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,880
-Mainly.
-Right.

211
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,720
Have you always lived there?
'Cos you don't sound--

212
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,920
I don't have the accent, no.
Everyone says that--

213
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,400
that... I don't have the accent.

214
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,760
Didn't grow up there though.
I grew up somewhere else.

215
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,840
Like London. I grew up in London.

216
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
Okay.

217
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,880
And is your mum and dad
on Hector's side or Penny's?

218
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,280
Someone crossing! Crossing!

219
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,480
Sorry about that! Can't miss his train.

220
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,120
This is me.

221
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,960
Great to meet you, Kenny.
Give my best to Penny, won't you?

222
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,600
-Yes, of course.
-Bye, then.

223
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,240
-Bye, Karen.
-Bye.

224
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,640
We're gonna make it, okay?

225
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,360
It's this junction.

226
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,120
-What? This one?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,680
You sure this is it?

228
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,960
"Look in the cake."

229
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,640
Let's look in the cake.

230
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
Look in the cake.

231
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,080
In the cake, I suppose.

232
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,400
I got something.

233
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
What the fuck?

234
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,240
Oh, my God.

235
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,960
"Five minutes to decide."

236
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,800
Decide what?

237
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,200
-"Who is driver?"
-"Who is robber?"

238
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,320
Oh, no. No.

239
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:02,240
-W-w-we can't. We...
-I'm driver.

240
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,600
You said you can't drive. I'm driver.

241
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,400
I'll be right here
with the engine running.

242
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,040
We-- We can't. We--

243
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,320
Then how else are we gonna deal
with this, Kenny?

244
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,800
-I'm not--
-Listen to me.

245
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,920
-I'm not--
-Shut up and listen!

246
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,440
Hat and sunglasses.
No one's going to ID you.

247
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,960
You could be Kevin fucking Bacon.
That's point one.

248
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,680
Shut up! Point two,
in a robbery, staff are trained.

249
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,720
I am not--

250
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,400
They are trained to hand over the cash.

251
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,160
No argument. I saw it in a documentary.
No resistance. It looked easy.

252
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,320
It's not easy.

253
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,400
I know it isn't easy, but what the fuck
else are we gonna do? Hey?

254
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,320
This gets out, I will lose my kids.

255
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,120
And I swear to God,
I will stand in the kitchen

256
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,240
and put a fucking bread knife
through my throat if that happens.

257
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,040
-I only looked at pictures and--
-And beat one off on camera?

258
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,720
That's what they got, yeah?

259
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,720
Your hot little face, blurred fist,
dick burping fucking spunk everywhere?

260
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:12,760
Your mum's gonna love that on Facebook,
Twitter, Insta-fucking-whatever.

261
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,360
And her friends.
All eyes on you, giving it that.

262
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Toss in the cunts at work,
calling you Spurty McGoo.

263
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,560
Laughing at your come face,
making it their desktop wallpaper.

264
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,480
It's not just weeks.
We're talking years here.

265
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,320
Pictures hang about on Google
like a gypsy fucking curse.

266
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,800
There's no cure for the Internet.
It would never go away.

267
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,920
It'd be glued to your name,
a fucking stain on you.

268
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,240
I'd hang myself if that was me.

269
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,480
Crack my fucking neck
at the first opportunity.

270
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,880
They just want the money,
so go in there and do it.

271
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,640
-You'll drive away.
-I am not gonna drive away.

272
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,040
I'm gonna be sat here
with the engine running.

273
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,920
I can't. I can't.

274
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
-You can. You can.
-I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

275
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,360
- You can.
- I can't.

276
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,760
We don't have much time, Kenny.

277
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,560
-It's not real. This is not real.
-You can do this.

278
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,680
Keep it together.
Please hold it together.

279
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,280
-Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!
-Okay.

280
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,440
Have you got a bag?

281
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,200
Glasses. Breathe through your nose.

282
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Give me money.

283
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,080
Just give me money!

284
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,560
-Yes. Okay.
-Lots of it. I need lots of it.

285
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,680
Sh-should I use your bag?

286
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,600
Take it.

287
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm going to pass this back
to you now. Is that okay?

288
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,080
There was some bloke standing there
on his phone freaking me out.

289
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,840
-Did you get it?
-Yeah.

290
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,640
Go faster.

291
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,600
Speed limit's 40.
Wanna get stopped for speeding now?

292
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,080
-Oh, shit.
-Fuck!

293
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,160
That's a siren.

294
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,840
Shh! Shush.

295
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
-Let's go!
-Shut up.

296
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,520
Wait, wait.

297
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,000
Come on.

298
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,440
Come on.

299
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,800
Okay.

300
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,960
We're okay.

301
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,000
We should text them, no?
Tell them we got the money.

302
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,400
-They say we got to take it somewhere.
-Where?

303
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,600
This is it.

304
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,600
Yeah.

305
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,040
Here we go.

306
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
"Final instruction."

307
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,920
"Take car away and destroy."

308
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,320
Destroy the car.

309
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,440
"Just you alone."

310
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,200
Why just you?

311
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,320
I got to take the money
somewhere over there.

312
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,240
Why? Why have I got to do it?

313
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,560
Fuck knows.

314
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,280
So...

315
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,840
You better go, yeah?

316
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,200
Hey, you got this far, haven't you?

317
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,640
Just drop it off. That's it.

318
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,440
You'll be all right.

319
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,520
Hey, listen, Kenny. Look.
I'm sorry about-- just back there.

320
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,360
Shouting at you. Calling you stuff.

321
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,320
I'm an all right bloke really.
I swear I am, when it's--

322
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,440
When stuff's normal.

323
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,520
You take care, yeah?

324
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,160
Yeah, yeah. Hang on, hang on.

325
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,400
They told me I had
to set this thing off first.

326
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,800
Okay.

327
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,800
You got the prize money?

328
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,160
-Prize money?
-You know, for the... fight?

329
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,560
How is there a fight?

330
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,320
-They didn't tell you?
-No.

331
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,920
We've got to fight...

332
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
...or else they post everything
they've got on us.

333
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,440
Winner takes the money.

334
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,760
We've got to do it.

335
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,160
I mean...

336
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:38,640
They're watching.

337
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,840
What sort of fight?
How do we know when it's over?

338
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,200
How... How do we know who's won?

339
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,200
I don't know about you,
but my life's over if this gets out.

340
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,200
Fucking over.

341
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,160
What they get you for?

342
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,080
I just looked at some photos.

343
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,760
That's all.
I just looked at one or two photos.

344
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,160
Yeah.

345
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,800
Yeah, yeah,
I just looked at pictures too.

346
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,560
How young were they? In the pictures?

347
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,920
How young?

348
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:40,960
Yeah.

349
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,840
Well, me too.

350
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,240
Look, mate. Don't. Please.

351
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,080
Please.

352
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,080
Please.

353
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,920
Mindy?

354
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,880
Is that what you've become?

355
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,080
-A dirty, sick, disgusting pervert?
-Hey, relax!

356
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,840
Look at me! Is that what you are?

357
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,400
<i>What did you do, Kenny?</i>
<i>They're saying it's kids!</i>

358
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,600
<i>That you've been looking at kids!</i>

359
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,040
<i>And Lindsey saw it.</i>
<i>There's a video of you.</i>

360
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,640
<i>All of her friends have got it!</i>

361
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,040
<i>Kids, Kenny! Tell me that's not true!</i>
