1
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,720
<i> Okay, my people!</i>
<i>Rise and shine. Get up, Stripe.</i>

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,400
Hey. You awake yet?

3
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,520
- Sure as shit ain't dreaming no more.
- Company!

4
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Something went down last night
in Her Falls,

5
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,800
a village about three miles east.

6
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,240
We've got reports of a food store
broken into, shit stolen.

7
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,640
Locals think it's roaches.

8
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,960
Roaches!

9
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,040
We head out in five minutes. Let's go!

10
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,960
Hey, so, it looks like you're getting
your first real-live roach hunt, huh?

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,440
Hey, new!

12
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,520
New!

13
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,440
It's Stripe.

14
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,640
Here's a little tip just in case
you get your first toe-to-toe

15
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,280
-with one of them roaches today.
-Uh-huh?

16
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,800
When you see one right here,

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,320
try not to shit your pants.
It's only gonna piss them off.

18
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,240
-I'll try.
-Try to ignore Len.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,680
His aim's so bad,
he's the only guy on Earth

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,840
who could shit his own pants and miss.

21
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,240
-Fuck you, farm girl.
-Farm girl?

22
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,400
Yeah. Hunting's in my blood.

23
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,440
Some of us are naturals.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,320
Moving out!

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,120
Whoo! Yeah!

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,680
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

27
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,320
You can speak now.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,520
- <i> It must have been roaches.</i>
- Roaches, you see them? You see?

29
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,680
<i>I didn't see them.</i>

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,920
<i> I heard them.</i>
<i>All the mess. It must have been them.</i>

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,200
Want a cookie?

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,680
- Here you go.
<i>-  They've been in the food.</i>

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,520
<i> We'll have to destroy</i>
<i>everything they left.</i>

34
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,480
<i>No one will eat it.</i>

35
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,960
We can replace that, okay?

36
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,240
<i> They destroyed the cooler.</i>
<i>Broke it and took the parts.</i>

37
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,040
The cooler?
They stole parts from the cooler?

38
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
Which way did they go?

39
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,400
<i> There were footprints</i>
<i>in the dirt leading that way.</i>

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,640
Parn Heidekker.

41
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,160
Parn Heidekker.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,200
Heidekker? Is that a name?

43
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,920
Stop them coming. Please, you must stop.

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Okay.

45
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,480
I have child who is scared.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
I will. I promise.

47
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,960
Stripe!

48
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Okay. Our friend here thinks
that the roaches

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,800
went in the direction
of Parn Heidekker's place.

50
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,160
Local oddball, seems to be some kind
of religious freak.

51
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Anderson, Hague, I want you
to stay here and help them torch the food,

52
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,040
keep them calm and reassured.

53
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,400
The rest of you,
we're gonna drop in on Heidekker.

54
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,400
Ask some questions,
sniff around the place.

55
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,240
If there's roaches,
we show we're ready for them. Let's go.

56
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,360
So Mr. Heidekker is not exactly
what you call a socialite or a mingler.

57
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
Seems like mental health issues.

58
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,680
He's got some interesting views
on roaches, by all accounts.

59
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,880
I'm putting his info
in your Mass system now.

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,440
Been complaints lodged against him
going months back.

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,800
Locals claim that he let roaches
cross his land, left food out for them.

62
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,560
Could be just shit talk
from the local villagers though so...

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,120
Yo, how many roaches
we got left out here?

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,160
A couple of thousand?
A couple of hundred, if that?

65
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,080
I mean, back home we had millions, man.

66
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,120
It only took two years
to get shit back on track.

67
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Out here you got rustic fucks
throwing them scraps.

68
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
No wonder it's taken so long
to mop shit up.

69
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
But how can anyone be dumb enough
to help a fucking roach?

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,920
Hell, yeah.

71
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,520
Portals front and rear.

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
Windows blacked out.

73
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,520
Chimney smoke. Someone's home.

74
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,400
Lennard, you use the boomer.

75
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,880
Okay, Mass check. Everyone got the layout?

76
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,000
- Check.
- Check.

77
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Check.

78
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,600
Aikin, Valcon, Coach,
you check the outbuildings here.

79
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,160
Take them one at a time and slow.

80
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,920
Stripe, Raiman,
you come with me and Lennard.

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
We go in here.

82
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,240
Len and I will talk to Heidekker,
you check the rest of the house.

83
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,760
Okay.

84
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,920
Optimal outcome, no shots fired.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,240
Except on a roach.

86
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
Except on a roach.

87
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,880
Morning, sir.

88
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,160
There's no need for this.
I speak your language.

89
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,520
Okay.

90
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,840
-What is it you want?
-Just to talk.

91
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,280
That's what we're doing.

92
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,320
Be a little more neighbourly
if we did it inside.

93
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,400
Check the upstairs rooms.

94
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,000
Relax. I'm not your enemy.

95
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,840
Where are they?

96
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,040
Where are who?

97
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
You know, we got a whole bunch

98
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,960
of frightened, angry people
in that village.

99
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,480
Roaches have been breaking
into the food stores, stealing supplies.

100
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,720
You know anything about that?

101
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,760
No.

102
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,200
See, it's not just what they stole.

103
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,920
All that food left is gonna be destroyed.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
- No one's gonna eat it.
- Stripe.

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,280
Makes life harder for everyone.

106
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,320
Cross on the wall there.
You got principles.

107
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,520
Think all life is sacred. And I get it.

108
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
I agree. All life is sacred so...

109
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,800
you even got to protect the roaches.
Right?

110
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,720
It's not their fault they're like that.
They didn't ask for this.

111
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,200
I get it. We get it.

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,000
Mm-hmm.

113
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,520
There's shit
in their blood that made them that way.

114
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,160
The sickness they're carrying.

115
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,280
That doesn't care about
the sanctity of life

116
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,520
or the pain
about who else is gonna suffer.

117
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:51,440
We don't stop the roaches,
in five, ten, 20 years from now,

118
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:55,360
you're still gonna get kids born that way,
and then they're gonna breed.

119
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
Bingo.

120
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,320
And so it goes on. That cycle of pain.

121
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,160
That sickness,
and it could have been avoided.

122
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,400
Fucking roach nest.

123
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,320
You check in there. I'll take the stairs.

124
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,280
Every roach you save today,

125
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:29,440
you condemn God knows how many people
to despair and misery tomorrow.

126
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,600
You can't still see them as human.

127
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,440
Understandable sentiment, granted,
but it's misguided.

128
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,960
We gotta take them out if humankind
is gonna carry on in this world.

129
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,080
That's just the hard truth.

130
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,120
Gotta make sacrifices.

131
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,960
What the fuck?

132
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,520
Help me out here!

133
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Fuck!

134
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,280
Rai!

135
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,760
We gotta listen to Mr. Sunday School
all the way back to base?

136
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,400
You can cover your ears.

137
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,600
Yeah, or, uh....
I'll just hit permanent mute.

138
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,520
Lower your weapon.

139
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,440
Roach lover counts as a kill too, right?

140
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
He's a civ, right?

141
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,800
You shoot a civ, that's gonna stay
with you the rest of your life.

142
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,160
Yo, Stripe, why don't you, uh...
pull the stick out of your ass?

143
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,000
Because I'm fucking with him, not you.

144
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,360
I guess I had you both going, right?

145
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,440
All right!

146
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,800
Let's torch the place.

147
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,240
Hey, you okay, man?

148
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah.

149
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,240
-I heard you popped one in there.
-Two.

150
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,280
Wait, two?

151
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,400
- I got another one, with my knife.
- With your knife? Holy shit!

152
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,280
-Pretty good, right?
-Yeah, you fucking Terminator.

153
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Damn! First time out, he gets two.

154
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,800
You lucky motherfucker, man.

155
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,320
Sweet dreams for this asshole.

156
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
Gonna get a treat tonight.

157
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,000
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

158
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,680
I love you.

159
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,600
Whoa! Miss Sharp Shooter.

160
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,120
Patronising fuck!

161
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,480
Ruthless! You're the Grim Reaper.

162
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,000
Yeah, well, no roach gets away next time.

163
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,000
Are you still sweating that?

164
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,880
Well, I grew up tracking deer.
You never give up.

165
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
I don't like it when they get away.

166
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,840
Nice.

167
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,680
Yeah,
if that fucker made it to the forest,

168
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,280
probably made it to the border,
gone for good.

169
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,880
Yeah. It's all right for you.

170
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,760
You popped two of 'em.

171
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,760
It's been a while for me.

172
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
You know, the gal is getting twitchy.

173
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,840
Come on, Rai.

174
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,440
You sleep good?

175
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,600
Yeah, I slept OK.

176
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,360
What, that's all you're gonna give me?

177
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Okay? You know, if I got two in one go,

178
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,320
I would want to come for like an hour!

179
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,600
All right, shut up.

180
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,400
All right.

181
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,280
Ah! That's the way.

182
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,320
Hey, you okay, man?

183
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,120
Yeah, think I'm tired is all.

184
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,960
Uh-huh?
All right, so you did have a good night.

185
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
39, 40, 41....

186
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,320
42...

187
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,080
43, 44, 45, 46,

188
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,560
47, 48, 49,

189
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,640
50, 51, 52,

190
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,040
53, 54, 55,

191
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,800
56, 57, 58, 59...

192
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,320
Strong and pure.

193
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,120
Strong and pure.

194
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,120
-Hey, Stripe, you okay?
-Yeah.

195
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
I mean, I... don't know.

196
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,080
I feel a little off.

197
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,360
I mean, I ain't sick or nothing.
It's just, uh...

198
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,200
Report to the sick bay.

199
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,520
Running diagnostic.

200
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
What do you see?

201
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,000
A cube.

202
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,240
-Rotating?
-Yeah.

203
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,240
-And now?
-A tree.

204
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,880
-Like an apple tree.
-Touch the apples for me.

205
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,280
Full marks.

206
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,200
-So you say you had like a headache?
-Yeah, but just quick.

207
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,640
Nothing big, just...

208
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,440
Well, everything looks okay.

209
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,120
No sign of any malfunction
or dropout with your Mass implant.

210
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,080
And physically,
you're in exemplary shape.

211
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,760
You've just seen combat,
you can expect some sort of side effect.

212
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,200
There was this, uh... this thing...

213
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,240
with a light on it at the farmhouse.

214
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
-Roach had it.
-A roach had it?

215
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,960
-Kind of like a flashlight.
-Flashlight?

216
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,400
Kinda.

217
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,760
I don't know.

218
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,160
Seriously, you're fine. Your Mass is fine.
Blood's fine. It's all fine.

219
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,200
Okay. Yeah.

220
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,600
Maybe you should speak to Arquette.

221
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,080
Who's Arquette?

222
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,400
So, you must be Koinanchey?

223
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,600
Koinange. Folks call me Stripe.

224
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,200
Why would they call you that?

225
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,760
Couldn't pronounce Koinange either,
I guess.

226
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
-That's funny.
-Thank you.

227
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,280
At ease, son. Sit down.

228
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,480
So you recently logged your first kills?

229
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,400
-Two roaches?
-Uh-huh.

230
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,040
First time out. It's impressive.

231
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,320
Yeah, I guess.

232
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,160
So what happened?

233
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
-What, with the kills?
-Mm-hmm.

234
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,800
Oh. I'm in this, uh... farmhouse.

235
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
There's this, like,
hidden room or something.

236
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,920
We go in and there they are.

237
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,320
First one, I just... It was automatic.
Just pop-pop, you know?

238
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,760
Right. Just like in training.

239
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,720
Yeah, just like that, yeah. Yeah.

240
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,960
-And the second?
-I mean, he was on the ground with me.

241
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,280
He?

242
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,280
It was a he.

243
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,840
Oh.

244
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,360
So, this was close quarters then?

245
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,760
Yeah, he's on top of me.
Struggling, I mean...

246
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,720
I couldn't reach my rifle
so I had to stick him.

247
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Stick it. With my knife.

248
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,760
And how did that... feel?

249
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,240
-What, like...?
-Emotionally.

250
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:35,400
I didn't. I mean, it was quick.
It was self-protection.

251
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,120
I guess all I felt was, you know, relief.

252
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,320
-Just relief?
-Uh-huh.

253
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,080
It's not unusual to experience
other feelings too.

254
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
A moment of euphoria even.

255
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,160
Yeah, I guess.

256
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,760
I don't know,
I thought maybe I'd feel...

257
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,080
I don't know.

258
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,840
-Something else?
-Yeah, like...

259
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,880
Regret. Something like that,
but that just wasn't there.

260
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,040
Hmm.

261
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,360
So you'd do it again?

262
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,040
Yeah, sure.

263
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,800
So... why are you here?

264
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,480
I don't know. I mean...

265
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,960
I had a few weird moments.

266
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,880
My Mass looked like it was glitching out.

267
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,920
But your implants,
I mean, they passed every diagnostic.

268
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,480
-There is nothing wrong with that?
-Yeah, they said it's fine.

269
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,120
I don't know, I think I just...

270
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,600
Felt like something was up with it.

271
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,560
-But there's not.
-No.

272
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,840
You did a big thing.
You should be proud of yourself.

273
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Okay?

274
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,000
It'll pass.

275
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,800
Let's get you a good sleep tonight, huh?

276
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
A real good sleep.

277
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,560
Fuck me.

278
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Way to go, fuck fingers.

279
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,640
It seems Heidekker didn't stay silent
too long once we got to work on him.

280
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,040
He's given up a location, someplace
the roaches have been scavenging.

281
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,360
Well, all right.

282
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,520
It's a housing project
that's been empty since the war.

283
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,680
It's not far from here.

284
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,880
So control wants us to do recon
before we go back to base.

285
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,400
Can we hurry it up here?

286
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,960
We ought to burn the whole forest down,
huh?

287
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,800
Give those roaches nowhere to run.

288
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay, you see that?

289
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,640
Solar panel looks cleaner than the rest.

290
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,720
And there are some cables.

291
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,480
-There's got to be roaches leaching power.
-Why here?

292
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,160
Christ knows.

293
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
All right.

294
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,800
Better dial it in.

295
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,360
Control. This is Medina.

296
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Positive ID. Signs of activity here
at the housing project location.

297
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,680
Sighted one solar panel, looks
recently wiped clean and some cabling.

298
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,360
Roger so far.

299
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,200
-You all right there?
-Smell the grass.

300
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,160
We can't usually smell nothing.

301
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,680
- You ever noticed that?
- No, I never noticed that.

302
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,800
Requesting course of action.

303
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,600
Didn't read. Please repeat.

304
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Okay.

305
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,160
Control says we should fall back
and await comm--

306
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,800
Shit!

307
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,400
Medina.

308
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,200
Oh!

309
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,760
Medina.

310
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,560
Stripe, get back! She's dead. Come on!

311
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,440
Okay. Ready? Cover me.

312
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,920
Rai! Rai, come on.

313
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,520
Okay.

314
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,400
Oh, fucking roach got a rifle.
Jesus Christ.

315
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,640
Fuck. Piece of shit.

316
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,560
Okay, Stripe.

317
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:45,080
Stripe, come on. Get it together, dude.

318
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,480
He fired six shots.
His rifle looks old, bolt action.

319
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,800
-Should take him ten seconds to reload.
-We go in?

320
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,280
We go in and take him out.
Are you with me?

321
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,400
-I'm with you.
-Let's go!

322
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,600
Follow me!

323
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:09,040
Ready? Okay, three, two, one. Cover me.

324
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,200
Come on, man! What the fuck?

325
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,720
What the fuck is this shit?

326
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,480
Let's go.

327
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,040
Stripe!

328
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,040
Whoa, whoa! It's okay. Hey. Hey.

329
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,120
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

330
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,160
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

331
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,240
I'm not gonna hurt you. Okay?

332
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,960
Go on, get out of here. Go on.

333
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,480
It's not safe. There's roaches here.

334
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,920
Go on. Get.

335
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,600
Come on!

336
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,960
- Rai, what did you do?
- Shut up! Come on!

337
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,000
What did you do, Rai?

338
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,680
Got ya.

339
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,800
Rai!

340
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,280
No!

341
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,200
-Run!
-What the fuck are you doing?

342
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,320
- You're killing them!
- They're roaches!

343
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,120
You're fucking killing them, Rai!
Fuck you!

344
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,680
What the fuck's wrong with you, man?
You got some blown shit.

345
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,640
-Pull it together!
-No.

346
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,800
Are you all right?

347
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,880
You gotta get out of here. Come on.

348
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,800
Come on!

349
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,680
Fuck!

350
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
You better run.

351
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,880
Shh. Shh.

352
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,280
Here.

353
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
I'm all right.

354
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,280
You see me as I am.

355
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Of course I see you.

356
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,920
You don't see roach?

357
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,800
You ain't a roach.

358
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,760
Roaches is all...

359
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,840
Fucked up?

360
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,520
Roaches don't speak.

361
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,840
You just can't hear us.

362
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,520
-What the fuck are you talking about?
-Your implants. Your army implants.

363
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,280
The Mass system?

364
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,680
They put it in your head to help you fight,

365
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,720
and when it works,
you see us as something other.

366
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,880
One of us, Luka,
was making a... a machine.

367
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,400
Light flashes.
Said it can interfere with the implant.

368
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,840
You're roaches?

369
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,080
But I've seen roaches.

370
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,920
I've seen them, they're fucking...
They're like, uh...

371
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,280
-Animals?
-No, they're monsters. I've seen them.

372
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,360
The implant made you see this.

373
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,800
Fuck. The villagers... Huh?

374
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:52,000
The locals, they... they ain't army.
They got no Mass in their heads.

375
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,640
They're scared of the roaches.

376
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,840
-They hate the fucking things.
-Everybody hates us.

377
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,480
Well, what the fuck do they see? Huh?

378
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,320
The fucking civs, when they look
at a roach, what do they see?

379
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,120
What you see now.

380
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,320
They hate all the same
because it's what they've been told.

381
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,240
Ten years ago, it began.

382
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:40,760
Post-war.

383
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:45,840
First, the screening programme,
the DNA checks,

384
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,320
then the register,
the emergency measures.

385
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,280
And soon everyone calls us creatures.
Filthy creatures.

386
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,280
Every voice. The TV. The computer.

387
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,960
Say we have... we have sickness in us.

388
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,960
We have weakness. It's in our blood.

389
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,880
They say that our blood cannot go on.

390
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,120
That we cannot go on.

391
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,520
My name was Catarina.

392
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,960
He was Alec.

393
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,760
Now we're just roach.

394
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:11,600
But now...

395
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,160
Now you see me.

396
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:25,880
Now you see me.

397
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,800
Rai?

398
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,120
Rai, no!

399
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,120
Tell me I shouldn't kill you.

400
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,680
-None of it's true, Rai.
-What the fuck got you?

401
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,000
None of it's true.

402
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,960
Fuck you.

403
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:20,080
Get up. Back against the wall.

404
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
Get up!

405
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,800
You want me to come in there?

406
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,560
It's all right. I can just talk to him.

407
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,520
Thank you, Briley.

408
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:49,880
Stripe.

409
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,480
We owe you an apology.
We didn't spot the fault in your Mass.

410
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,320
I got you a coffee.

411
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:27,400
The device you found in the farmhouse,
you mentioned it to the doctor.

412
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,400
Is this the thing?

413
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,680
We found it on an old block
that you and Raiman were searching.

414
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,240
Looks like they reverse engineered it
from some of our drone parts and so on.

415
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,560
The light here transmits a code.
It's like a virus.

416
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,680
It burrows into your Mass,
trying to shut it down from within.

417
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,640
I tell you, those roaches
are getting more ingenious

418
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,960
than we give them credit for.

419
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,400
The whole thing is a lie.

420
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,280
I understand why you'd say that, yeah.

421
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,680
Roaches.

422
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,720
They look just like us.

423
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:14,000
Of course they do.

424
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,040
That's why they're so dangerous.

425
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,280
Humans.
You know, we give ourselves a bad rap,

426
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,360
but we're genuinely empathetic
as a species.

427
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,440
I mean, we don't actually really want
to kill each other.

428
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,440
Which is a good thing.

429
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,040
Until your future depends
on wiping out the enemy.

430
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,360
Come on, sit down.

431
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,720
I don't know how much history
you studied in school.

432
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,360
Many years ago,
I'm talking early 20th century,

433
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,400
most soldiers
didn't even fire their weapons.

434
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,120
Or if they did, they would just aim
over the heads of the enemies.

435
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,440
They did it on purpose.

436
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,800
British Army. World War I.

437
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,320
The brigadier,
he'd walk the line with a stick

438
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:22,280
and he'd whack his men
in order to get them to shoot.

439
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,320
Even in World War II, in a firefight,

440
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,400
only 15%, 20% of the men
would pull the trigger.

441
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:34,880
The fate of the world at stake
and only 15% of them fired.

442
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,560
Now what does that tell you?

443
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,840
It tells me that that war
would have been over a whole lot quicker

444
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,320
had the military got its shit together.

445
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,800
So we adapted.

446
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,040
Better training. Better conditioning.

447
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,640
Then comes the Vietnam War,

448
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,600
and the shooting percentage goes up to 85.

449
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:00,200
Lot of bullets flying.
The kills were still low.

450
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:02,040
Plus the guys who did get a kill,

451
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,000
well, most of them came back
all messed up in the head.

452
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,880
And that's pretty much how things stayed
until Mass came along.

453
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,040
You see, Mass...
Well, that's the ultimate military weapon.

454
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,520
It helps you with your intel.

455
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,280
Your targeting. Your comms.
Your conditioning.

456
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,560
It's a lot easier to pull the trigger
when you're aiming at the bogeyman, hmm?

457
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,600
It's not just your eyes, though.
Takes care of your other senses, too.

458
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,520
You don't hear the shrieks.

459
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,480
You don't smell the blood and the shit.

460
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,200
They're human beings.

461
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,200
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that's in their DNA?

462
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,160
Higher rates of cancer.

463
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:01,360
Muscular dystrophy.
MS. SLS. Substandard IQ.

464
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,600
Criminal tendencies. Sexual deviances.

465
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,720
It's all there.

466
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,800
The screening shows it.

467
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,120
Is that what you want
for the next generation?

468
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,080
Don't feel bad about doing your job.

469
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,360
The villagers won't do it.

470
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,720
The folks back home won't do it.

471
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,240
They don't have Mass.

472
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:29,280
Mass lets you do it.

473
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,160
You.

474
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,520
You're protecting the bloodline.

475
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,640
And that, my friend, is an honour.

476
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,880
There's no honour here.

477
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,880
It's just killing.

478
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,360
-Lying and killing.
-No one lied to you.

479
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,720
You knew all of this. All along.

480
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,400
What are you talking about?

481
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,080
You agreed
to have your Mass implant put in.

482
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:04,040
Set up. Every soldier does.

483
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,560
We can't just embed it and feed you
a dream. Your mind would reject it.

484
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,920
You have to accept it. Willingly.

485
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,920
It's exactly what you did.

486
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,800
<i> So you see the terms</i>
<i>and conditions there?</i>

487
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,640
<i>Yeah, that's like a whole essay, man.</i>

488
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:27,520
What is that?

489
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,160
That's your consent video.
From when you signed up six months ago.

490
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,640
<i> Basically, it says you agree</i>
<i>to Mass implant activation.</i>

491
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,240
-I didn't do this.
-Yes, you did.

492
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,680
- <i> Works kind of like hypnosis.</i>
<i>- Yeah, all right.</i>

493
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,040
<i> Part of what you're agreeing to</i>
<i>is not realising</i>

494
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,520
<i>you've been put in this state.</i>

495
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,920
<i>If you follow me.</i>
<i>You won't recall this conversation.</i>

496
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,160
<i>That's kind of funny, man.</i>

497
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,760
Turn it off.

498
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,120
- <i> So for you to register consent...</i>
- Turn it off, man.

499
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,880
<i>I'm gonna need your thumbprint there.</i>

500
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,240
<i>- Right here?</i>
<i>-  Yes, please.</i>

501
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,040
<i>That's dope.</i>

502
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,920
I didn't do that!

503
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,680
-I don't remember that!
-Just like the man said.

504
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,320
-I know you're upset.
-Fuck you!

505
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,200
-What's happening?
-We control what you see, Stripe.

506
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,400
-I can't see nothing.
-Because we control it.

507
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,000
Give me my fucking eyes back.

508
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:44,680
-Let me lay out your options.
-Give me my fucking eyes back, man!

509
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:47,960
Let me lay out your options!

510
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,160
Option one,
you agree to have your Mass reset.

511
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,320
All the recollections
of the past few days,

512
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,680
including this conversation, erased.

513
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,160
No way.

514
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:09,080
Option two's incarceration.

515
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,120
-I'd advise you to consider.
-Fuck you!

516
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:12,880
Mass is a friend.

517
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,120
Without it, you will remember
everything that you did.

518
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,000
I ain't having this Mass shit.

519
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,920
No more. No way.

520
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,120
Okay.

521
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:28,080
Well...

522
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,400
Maybe you should see
what life would be like without it.

523
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,880
What's happening?

524
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:41,520
Where am I?

525
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,840
Heidekker's ranch. Three days ago.

526
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:56,560
I have it all logged, Stripe.
We can feed you everything that you did.

527
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:03,040
Hey, no, no, no. No.

528
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,120
Please! Please don't shoot. Please!
Please! Please don't shoot.

529
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,240
-Please! Please!
-No! No!

530
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,880
No. Make it stop.

531
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,920
No! Please.

532
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:14,880
Make it stop!

533
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,920
Please!

534
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,880
No! No!

535
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,160
No!

536
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,520
Fuck off! Stop it!

537
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,880
No!

538
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:59,400
You'll see and smell and feel it all.

539
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,440
Is this what you want?

540
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,080
On a loop? In a cell all alone?

541
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,880
We can make that go away.

542
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:32,640
This conversation goes away too.

543
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,920
All of it.

544
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:38,200
But you gotta say the word.

545
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Just say the word, Stripe.

546
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,240
And it all goes away.

547
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:57,520
Just say the word.
