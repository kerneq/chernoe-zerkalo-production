1
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,280
<i> Belinda Carlisle there with one</i>
<i>of the biggest hits of 1987 so far.</i>

2
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,520
<i>Gotta love that track!</i>
<i>Coming up next in just a moment...</i>

3
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,600
Could you please stop it?
I just wanna have some fun, okay?

4
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,760
Kelly, come on.

5
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,280
-Kelly.
-I'm still walking, Wes.

6
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,520
We've only got a couple of hours
so let's, uh... let's use it.

7
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I am using it.

8
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,640
Hey.

9
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,320
You're good at this.

10
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,640
It's, uh... got different endings.

11
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,800
Depending on if you're in one
or two player.

12
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
Uh-huh?

13
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,600
- It was kinda the first game to do that.
- Damn it!

14
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,800
Do you wanna play <i>Top Speed</i>?

15
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,600
Oh, no.

16
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,360
Thank you.
I just wanna get my bearings a bit.

17
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,600
Uh... okay.

18
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,480
-See you around?
-Mm-hmm.

19
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,640
Go along with whatever I say.

20
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,240
-Sorry?
-Whatever I say, go along with it.

21
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,520
Okay, Wes, you're just pestering now.

22
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,520
-Do I have to red light you?
-Two hours 35.

23
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,080
-There's not much time left.
-Wes.

24
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,160
Look...

25
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,600
-Last week, we had the most amazing--
-Last week was last week.

26
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,240
I need to talk with my friend here, okay?
Haven't seen her in a while.

27
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,920
Wes, she's sick.

28
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
Like "six months to live" sick.

29
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
Five, actually.

30
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,000
I need to catch up with her.
Private time.

31
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
Okay.

32
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
Okay.

33
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,760
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-That's okay.

34
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,320
See you around?

35
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,040
Sure.

36
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,200
Sorry for killing you.

37
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,240
The whole "six months to live" thing?

38
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,080
Sorry. Five.

39
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,840
Five was a nice touch.

40
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,120
-Kelly.
-Yorkie.

41
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,680
-Yurgie?
-Yorkie.

42
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Like the dog breed?

43
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Yeah.

44
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,560
He's not a bad guy. I feel kinda bad.

45
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,040
-Met him at the Quagmire so...
-What's the Quagmire?

46
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,000
If you don't already know
what the Quagmire is,

47
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,040
you probably don't wanna know.

48
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,120
No?

49
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,320
You want another one?

50
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,200
-Oh, no, I--
-Yeah, you do. Come on.

51
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,960
Do I have to tug your leash?

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,920
-Hey, Blondie.
-I'm Blondie?

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,280
You are. Jack and Coke times two.

54
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,520
-Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.
-Times two.

55
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,920
-What are you doing?
-I'm... regarding you.

56
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,360
I feel like I'm being analysed.

57
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,280
-Why the glasses?
-Um...

58
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,680
I like them. They totally work on you.
But do you need them?

59
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,440
-Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
-Knew it!

60
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,840
I used to wear them in school.

61
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,040
So I guess now
they're just kind of a... comfort thing.

62
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,520
I figured they were
kind of a fashion statement.

63
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,040
-Really?
-But then the rest of your outfit is not.

64
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,960
Don't take that wrong.
It's refreshing. I mean, look around.

65
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,280
People try so hard to look
how they think they should look.

66
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,200
They probably saw it in some movie.

67
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,080
But I like these.

68
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,440
You're authentically you.

69
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Thanks.

70
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Cheers.

71
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,960
You never tasted it before?

72
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,400
No, I...

73
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,200
I just haven't had it in a while.
It's good.

74
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Do you live here?

75
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
-No. Oh, uh--
-Tourist?

76
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,120
We'll go with tourist.
So you're new here?

77
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
-First night.
-First night? Wow, okay!

78
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Oh, my God!

79
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,800
We<i> have</i> to dance to this.

80
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,400
-With each other?
-Uh-huh.

81
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,680
-Oh, no. Dance floors aren't my thing.
-Oh, let's not limit ourselves.

82
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,040
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can, come on.

83
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,000
-No, I'll look dumb--
-Just follow my lead!

84
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,480
Copy me.

85
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You got it.

86
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Hey!

87
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:23,160
-Why did you run away?
-Oh, sorry.

88
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,640
I... I said I'm not much of a dancer.

89
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,760
No shit.

90
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,520
Like a frightened horse
on a frozen lake back there.

91
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm kidding. Half kidding.

92
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Sorry I pushed you into it.

93
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,200
Saturday nights once a week.
It's like no time. I get impatient.

94
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,160
No, no, it's not that. It's...

95
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,640
-Everyone was looking.
-Looking?

96
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,440
Yeah. You know, two girls dancing.

97
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,560
Okay, one, folks are way less uptight
than they used to be.

98
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,320
And two, this is a party town.
No one's judging.

99
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,080
Face it. If they were staring,
it's because I am bodacious.

100
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,800
-You're stupid.
-Thank you!

101
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,800
-I've never been on a dance floor.
-Never?

102
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,960
As in the whole time
you've been alive never?

103
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,000
Never.

104
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,960
What are you, like, Amish?

105
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,240
That's one sheltered existence
you got there.

106
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,520
Yeah, well.

107
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,240
As far as my family's concerned,
I can't do anything.

108
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Well, no one knows
about even half the shit I get up to.

109
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,560
With your folks, though,
it's from a place of love, though, right?

110
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,320
-They worry.
-They don't worry.

111
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,760
Just the concept of me enjoying myself
would blow their minds.

112
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,680
What would you like to do?
That you've never done?

113
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,640
Oh...

114
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,800
So many things.

115
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,880
San Junipero is a party town.

116
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,240
All up for grabs.

117
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,760
Midnight's two hours away.

118
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh, that's not long.

119
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,080
Why waste time sitting here?

120
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,640
I, um...

121
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,760
-Listen...
-It's okay.

122
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,200
-No, I mean...
-Really, it's okay.

123
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,160
No, I'm, uh...
I'm engaged. I have a fiancÃ©.

124
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,880
-He's called Greg.
-And is Greg here?

125
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,520
-No, he's--
-Elsewhere?

126
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,840
Yeah.

127
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,160
Oh.

128
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,840
Wanna go to bed with me?

129
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,400
We could be back at mine in like...

130
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,040
I never did anything like that.

131
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,480
All the more reason.

132
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
Oh, you're nice.

133
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,160
-I can't.
-Okay.

134
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,960
-I just... I can't.
-I get it.

135
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,080
-I have to go.
-In this?

136
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,120
It's been really great to meet you.

137
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Likewise.

138
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Okay.

139
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,120
Okay.

140
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
Okay.

141
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,080
Shit.

142
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,120
-What the hell, Wes?
-Look, I know I'm coming across--

143
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,920
-I'm red lighting you, for real. Okay?
-No, don't do that. Just...

144
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,640
-Then stop this.
-Can you hear me out? Please? Please.

145
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,280
How many girls do you think there are
in San Junipero?

146
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,880
Hundreds? Thousands?

147
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't care.

148
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,680
I'm saying there's plenty
of other girls out there for you, Wes.

149
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:43,080
The locals? They're like dead people.

150
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,240
A little lively for dead people.

151
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,920
Look, I don't want some kind
of boring romance, okay?

152
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,800
Like, Jesus,
put us in a retirement home deal.

153
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,320
Well, if you're looking for someone
to fuck, there's options.

154
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,760
-Hang out at the Quagmire again.
-It's not just sex.

155
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,840
-It was just sex.
-No, we made a connection.

156
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,720
Wes, it was just sex.

157
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,040
-No--
-No roots.

158
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,400
We had fun.

159
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,280
Enjoy the town, for God's sake.

161
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
-Hey.
-Hey.

162
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,400
Waiting for someone?

163
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,160
Not really.

164
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,280
I'll get you a drink?

165
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,360
Uh, yeah, sure.

166
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,480
So, uh... yeah,
it was microsurgery, I guess.

167
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,360
You know, both my kneecaps
had kind of just worn down.

168
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,680
You know, I never got this song.
Kind of weird.

169
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,840
-Shall we dance?
-Sure.

170
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,200
I mean, I guess by the time
I'd put my mind to, like, computing.

171
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,760
You know, caught that first wave,
would have had a different story.

172
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Gotta use the bathroom.

173
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Okay.

174
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,120
-I don't know how to do this.
-Do what?

175
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,760
Just help me.

176
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,920
Can you just...

177
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,560
Just make this easy for me?

178
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,040
You wanna get in my car?

179
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,040
-How long have you been here?
-Sorry?

180
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,880
-How long have you been here?
-In San Junipero?

181
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,760
Uh... Couple of months.
Plan is long enough to enjoy myself.

182
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,400
Guess I'm a tourist, like you.

183
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,520
Yeah.

184
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,800
Hey. You okay?

185
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
Yeah.

186
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,520
Stop!

187
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,240
Sorry, but...

188
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,160
Man, your face!

189
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
Wow.

190
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,920
-You like it?
-It's just so big.

191
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Reminds me of where I grew up.

192
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,400
Miss your mom?

193
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,120
You have to show me.

194
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

195
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,560
You never slept with a woman before?

196
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,760
That's not a critique.
I mean, it was fucking awesome.

197
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,160
No, never with a woman.

198
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,800
Never with anyone.

199
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,760
Not anyone?

200
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,720
-What, in town or...?
-No. No one, nowhere.

201
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,560
-I guess you deflowered me.
-I deflowered you?

202
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
What is this? Merry England?

203
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,840
Shut up.

204
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,920
You've had relationships though.

205
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,800
Mnh-mnh.

206
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,880
Hello! You got a fiancÃ©.

207
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,480
-It's complicated.
-Yeah, I'll say.

208
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,840
When did you know...

209
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,400
-that you liked women?
-I like men too.

210
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,120
Equal rights.

211
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Okay.

212
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,480
But when did you know?

213
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,760
Do you always know?

214
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,360
I was married to a guy.
A long time, I was married.

215
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,800
I always knew.

216
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
I mean, I'd be attracted to other girls,

217
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,360
co-workers, friends,
some waitress that served me.

218
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,800
They were crushes.
God, they were crushes.

219
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Never acted on any of it.

220
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,600
Never did anything.

221
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,640
I was in love with him.

222
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,640
I really was in love with him.

223
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:15,840
But he chose not to stick around.

224
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,960
So now it's me.
And I'm passing through.

225
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:30,400
And before I leave,
I'll have a good time.

226
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm just gonna have a good time.

227
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
Time's nearly up.

228
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,040
Then let's lie here.

229
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,040
Excuse me?

230
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,320
Have you seen Kelly?

231
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,240
-What's that?
-Kelly.

232
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,680
I haven't seen her all night.

233
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,520
You tried the Quagmire?

234
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,440
What is the Quagmire?

235
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,960
-Whoa! Hey!
-I'm sorry!

236
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
Yeah, I know you from somewhere.

237
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,160
Tucker's.

238
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,400
-Kelly's friend, huh?
-Do you know where to find her?

239
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,040
-How would I know that?
-You're her friend.

240
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,920
<i>-Was</i> a friend.
-Has she been here?

241
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,080
No.

242
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,640
You too, huh?

243
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Well...

244
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:09,320
Hey. Try a different time.

245
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,600
Here in '80, the '90s, 2002 one time.

246
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
She's worth the shot, right?

247
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,320
<i>Introducing the totally redesigned</i>
<i>Chrysler Cordoba.</i>

248
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,920
<i>All the luxury you expect is here.</i>

249
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,960
<i>But so is gas mileage...</i>

250
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,520
No, no, no.

251
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,720
-Hey.
-Hey.

252
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,440
Golden age, right?

253
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,800
-Right.
-You playing or...

254
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,000
I'm sorry, I'm looking for someone.

255
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,200
Maybe... next time.

256
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
Kelly?

257
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,520
Yeah!

258
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,120
<i> You're beautiful!</i>

259
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,480
<i>-Select a song!</i>
-Hi.

260
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,120
Ladies' room.

261
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,440
Hey.

262
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,640
Hey. No, you--

263
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,760
Wait a minute.

264
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,440
Why are you here?

265
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,680
I was looking for you.
Where did you go?

266
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,440
I like a change of music.

267
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
How the hell is this your era?

268
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,200
-You hid from me.
-One, I did not.

269
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:20,000
Two, I owe you zero.
And three... see point two.

270
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,040
It's not about who owes who.
It's about manners.

271
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,320
You don't know who I am.

272
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,880
You don't know what this means.

273
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,080
This means fun.

274
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,120
Or it should. And this...

275
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,440
This is not fun, okay?

276
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,120
This is not fun.

277
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,920
So you don't feel bad?

278
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,520
Maybe you should feel bad.
Or at least feel something.

279
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,760
Have you seen a girl?
Mid-20s, brown hair, glasses?

280
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,400
Uh...

281
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,560
Oh, jeez.

282
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Hey.

283
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,360
Please tell me
you got your pain slider set to zero.

284
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,520
Yeah, I think so.

285
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,600
-Okay, listen.
-How many of them are dead?

286
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,320
Like what percentage?

287
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,160
As in full-timers?

288
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,800
Eighty. Eighty-five.

289
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,560
I'm sorry.

290
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,840
-I'm not gonna jump.
-I know, and I'm sorry, whatever it's...

291
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:14,480
In the time I've been here,
I said I wouldn't...

292
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,120
I don't know, do feelings.

293
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,680
You freaked me out.

294
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,240
I don't want to like anyone.

295
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,360
So you've been just...
totally fucking inconvenient.

296
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,800
It's that...

297
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,880
I don't know how long there is.

298
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,680
And I can't. I wasn't prepared for you.
For wanting something--

299
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,840
Next week it is.

300
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,040
I'm getting married.

301
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,000
Next week?

302
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,920
To nice Greg?

303
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,800
-Sure you're going through with that?
-I have to.

304
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,640
-You have to?
-Mm-hmm.

305
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,360
He really is a good guy.

306
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,520
I mean, my family don't approve, but...

307
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,760
they can't stop us.

308
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,360
I know he pities me. That pisses me off.

309
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,400
But that's not fair 'cause he's...

310
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,880
You said you don't know
how much time there is.

311
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
What does that mean?

312
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,800
They tell me three months.

313
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,680
It's spread basically everywhere.

314
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,200
They said three months before
six months ago.

315
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,200
So, you know, what do they know?

316
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,880
Doesn't even taste of anything.

317
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,440
-But so you'll stay here after?
-No.

318
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,240
When I'm done, I am done.

319
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,560
But that's cra-- I mean...

320
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,880
-Why?
-Richard.

321
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,640
That's...

322
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,400
My husband's name was Richard.

323
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,960
He died just two years ago.

324
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,880
So we had the opportunity
to stay in San Junipero.

325
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,960
Pass over.

326
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,160
Didn't take it.

327
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:22,760
-Didn't want to take it.
-Why wouldn't anyone take it?

328
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,600
He had his viewpoint.

329
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,600
There were things he believed
and things he didn't believe in,

330
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,360
and this place was one of them.

331
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,200
Wouldn't even visit. Take the trial run.

332
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,520
Shit.

333
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:48,040
I didn't know if I wanted to try it
but... I mean...

334
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,960
Jesus, without this place,
I never would've met someone like you.

335
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,000
-Yeah, you could have.
-No, I wouldn't.

336
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,320
-We could have met outside all this.
-No.

337
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,760
You... would not have got me at all.

338
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,920
At all.

339
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
If we really met, I mean...

340
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,360
If we<i> really</i> met, you wouldn't like me.

341
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,280
Try me.

342
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,640
Or you'd--
You wouldn't want to spend time with me.

343
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,960
-You'd come and then--
-Try me.

344
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,040
Why?

345
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,640
Why? What's the point?

346
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,840
What? Where are you? Houston?

347
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,560
Carson City, Nevada.

348
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,680
So come on.

349
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,840
I showed you mine.

350
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,720
Where are you?

351
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,240
-I can just look it up.
-Santa Rosa, California.

352
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,040
-That's no distance.
-I don't want you to--

353
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,240
-I don't want you to see me. I'm scared--
-And I'm dying.

354
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,240
Whatever you are can't scare me.

355
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,560
Let me come visit.

356
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,120
I want to say hi.

357
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,040
Here you go.

358
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,560
You okay?

359
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,840
<i>Please check in at our self-service pods</i>

360
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,720
<i>using swipe cards provided.</i>

361
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,480
-You must be Kelly.
-I guess I must.

362
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,800
-She's waiting for you.
-Thank you.

363
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,600
Please.

364
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,160
She won't be able
to physically respond in any way.

365
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,080
But she can hear you.

366
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,200
I'll give you some privacy.

367
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,520
Hello, stupid.

368
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,440
It's good to see you.

369
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,360
Uh... Hello. Excuse me. Is it... Kelly?

370
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,240
It is.

371
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,480
-I'm Greg.
-You're Greg?

372
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,880
Holy shit.

373
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,720
Yeah, I think it's great
that you came down here in person

374
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,080
before she passes over.

375
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,920
Even her folks
don't come visit no more so...

376
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,280
She's passing over?

377
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,240
-When?
-Uh...

378
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,680
-Let's go grab a coffee.
-Okay.

379
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,360
-She didn't tell you?
-No, she did not.

380
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,960
-Said she was just visiting.
-More like sampling the trial version.

381
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:40,680
I mean, I've only known her
the past three years.

382
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,720
We talk on the comm box.

383
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,440
She told you how she ended up
quadriplegic?

384
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,360
And how long she's been that way?

385
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,480
One night, she's 21,
comes out to her folks.

386
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,240
They're a little uptight about it,
you might say.

387
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,080
They told her they don't
want a gay daughter.

388
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,240
It's not natural and so forth.

389
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,360
They fight. She gets in her car.
Runs it off the road. Boom!

390
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,560
-When she was 21?
-More than 40 years back.

391
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,680
It's been her whole lifetime, basically.

392
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,280
So the whole San Junipero system
has been a big deal for her.

393
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,880
The biggest deal.

394
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,880
Of course now, until she passes over,
it goes permanent,

395
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,360
she's on a five-hour weekly limit.

396
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,320
I guess you're the same.

397
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:32,880
They ration it out.
They don't trust us with more.

398
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,960
They say you go crazy
if you have too much, you know?

399
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,920
You don't leave your seat.
You disassociate body from mind.

400
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,040
Like that doesn't happen
in every senior home already.

401
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,360
The system's there
for therapeutic reasons,

402
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,400
immersive nostalgia therapy.

403
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,000
Plunge you into a world of memories.

404
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,080
Helps with Alzheimer's,
that's what they say.

405
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,400
Small mercies.

406
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,040
So...

407
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,080
About this marriage...

408
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,400
The state's got a triple lockdown
on euthanasia cases.

409
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,600
You gotta have a sign-off from the doc,
the patient, a family member.

410
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:17,080
It's to stop folks from passing over just
because they prefer San Junipero flat out.

411
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,000
Anyhow, Yorkie's family,

412
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:22,280
they're big-time religious,
and they will not sign.

413
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:24,600
But a spouse can override them.

414
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,800
-Hence the wedding bells.
-You got it.

415
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,920
We got a pastor coming tomorrow a.m.,

416
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,840
and then she's scheduled to pass
tomorrow afternoon.

417
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,280
"Scheduled to pass."
Let's just call it dying.

418
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,360
If you can call it dying.

419
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,560
Uploaded to the cloud, sounds like heaven.

420
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,720
I guess.

421
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:47,880
You gonna wear a suit?

422
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
The ceremony's on my coffee break.

423
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,040
I never married so I just figured,
you know, what's the harm?

424
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,440
You're a good man.

425
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,920
It's the least I could do, right?

426
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,760
Think you could hook us up
to the system now?

427
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,880
Just for a little while,
before she passes?

428
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,560
You can still see her afterwards.
I mean, then she's no limit.

429
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,480
She's full, fat, permanent San Juniperan.

430
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,720
I know, but can you?

431
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,400
Seriously, it is so tight here
that they monitor every--

432
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,440
I only want a moment.

433
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:45,440
Ma'am.

434
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,520
-You got five minutes
-Thank you.

435
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,360
Hey!

436
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,720
I've never been here
during the daylight.

437
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,720
It's warm.

438
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,440
Listen, I gotta be quick.
So I spoke to Greg.

439
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,640
Oh.

440
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,800
-You're passing over tomorrow?
-Yeah.

441
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,600
Couple of hours after the wedding.

442
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,760
So I guess I am technically
honeymooning here forever.

443
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,480
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

444
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,600
-I'm gonna say something crazy.
-Okay.

445
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,400
Wanna marry me instead?

446
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,360
It's just... Greg seems great, but...

447
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,000
Why not someone you've connected with?

448
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,840
Is that a yes?

449
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,360
...to be your lawfully wedded wife,

450
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,600
to have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,

451
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,480
in good times and in woe,
for richer, for poorer...

452
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,800
Hold tight.

453
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,440
There you go.

454
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Nearly there.

455
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,000
That's it.

456
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,000
Are you sure you're all right?

457
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,080
Hey!

458
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,800
You didn't dress up to see me?

459
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,560
Oh...

460
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:03,080
Come on!

461
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:07,320
Better?

462
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,440
Whoop!

463
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,840
Oh!

464
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh! Whoo!

465
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,720
Looks so real.

466
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,760
It feels so real!

467
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:45,520
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I love it here!

468
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,600
I just love it.

469
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:50,360
-You've been here before.
-But now I live here!

470
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,160
Be with me.

471
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,120
-I'm with you now.
-That's not what I mean.

472
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,400
Pass over.

473
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,680
-When it's your time.
-Yorkie.

474
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,120
-Stay here with me.
-Can we just enjoy tonight?

475
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,200
It's almost midnight.

476
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,640
In ten minutes, you're out of here.

477
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,360
Then I gotta wait a week
to see you again.

478
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,560
-You know I'm just a visitor.
-What, a couple of months, then what?

479
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,360
-We're not discussing this.
-Then you're gone.

480
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:24,280
-Just gone. You could have forever.
-Forever?

481
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,600
-Who can even make sense of forever?
-However long you want then.

482
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,280
I mean, you can remove yourself
like that.

483
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,160
It's not a trap.

484
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,640
I mean, look at it! Jesus! Touch it!

485
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,040
-I'm going.
-Hey! Oh. Hey.

486
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,920
It's real.

487
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,480
This is real.

488
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,720
And this.

489
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,760
-Hmm?
-Come on.

490
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,680
You know that was just a gesture.

491
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,360
-You married me.
-To help you pass over.

492
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:03,320
-As a... kindness.
-It's not so kind to leave.

493
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,360
Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...

494
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,160
I got this chance.

495
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,040
<i>We</i> got this chance.
I wanna share it with you.

496
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,080
I said I made my choice.

497
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,280
What is it? You feel bad
because your husband isn't here?

498
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,960
-Because that was his choice.
-Don't.

499
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,720
He chose not to stay here.
It's like he left you.

500
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,760
You know, he could have stayed,
but he chose to leave you.

501
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,120
-You don't know what you're saying.
-You should be mad at him.

502
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,240
-Not whipping yourself with guilt.
-Get off me.

503
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,200
You can't see it!
But what he did, it was selfish actually!

504
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,320
Forty-nine years...

505
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,760
I was with him for 49 years.

506
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,360
You can't begin to imagine.

507
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,080
You can't know...

508
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,480
the bond, the commitment, the boredom,

509
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,920
the yearning, the laughter,
the love of it.

510
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,560
The fucking love. You just cannot know!

511
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,680
Everything we sacrificed.

512
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,640
The years I gave him.
The years he gave me.

513
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,080
Did you think to ask?

514
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,640
Did it occur to you to ask?

515
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,600
We had a daughter.

516
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,560
Alison.

517
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,360
Always difficult, always beautiful.

518
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,160
Died at 39 years old, bless her heart.

519
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:50,320
And Richard and I,
we felt that heartbreak as one.

520
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,520
You think you're the only person
ever suffered, go fuck yourself.

521
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,800
-Well, I didn't know--
-Didn't think to.

522
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:00,880
You know, when he was dying,
Richard said to me

523
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,600
when they offered him this,
to pass over, pass through,

524
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:07,360
spend eternity in this fucking graveyard
you're so in love with,

525
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:13,120
he said, "How can I?
When she missed out, how can I?"

526
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,600
And so he went.

527
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And I wish I could believe he's
with her now,

528
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,720
that they're together, but I don't.

529
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,640
I believe they're nowhere.
Just like you said.

530
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,320
Gone. No, I pitied you,
and that's the truth. I pitied you.

531
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,800
Now you give me some sales pitch

532
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,760
about how fucking peachy forever
could be.

533
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,880
I'm sorry.

534
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,160
You wanna spend forever
somewhere nothing matters?

535
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,040
End up like Wes?

536
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,240
All those lost fucks at the Quagmire

537
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:45,400
trying anything to feel something,
go ahead.

538
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,400
But I'm out. I'm gone.

539
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:56,360
Kelly, I'm sorry. Kelly!

540
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,400
Hey, Kelly.

541
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,400
-You all right?
-Yeah, I am fine.

542
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:17,240
-Well, okay then.
-Huh?

543
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:22,680
Kelly?

544
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,920
All things considered...

545
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,400
I guess I'm ready.

546
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,040
For what?

547
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,320
For the rest of it.

548
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,480
Ready?
