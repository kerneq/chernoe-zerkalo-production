00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:35,060
DOOR OPENS

3
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,020
Ahem.

4
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,940
They're ready for you.

5
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,220
Gwendolyn Harris. We've met.

6
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,500
Bournemouth.

7
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,220
But you don't know the others.

8
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:48,300
No, but I'm familiar with you.

9
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,860
Why do you want to be an MP?

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,300
Because I'm not satisfied
with the way things are,

11
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,620
and rather than sit back and moan
I'd prefer to do something about it.

12
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,940
Go again from the top.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,620
I don't know why anyone's surprised
the world's number one teen idol

14
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,020
has become a Scientologist.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,580
Speed up the autocue, please.

16
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,740
Pop stars do believe in weird things.

17
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,140
'Abba believed in angels.
R Kelly believed he could fly...'

18
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,380
They said show you this.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,860
This happened just now?

20
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,500
Mm-hmm.

21
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,020
Gladwell?

22
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,740
"Shamed Tory Jason Gladwell
resigns," - capitals -

23
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,660
"over Twitter porn pics scandal."

24
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,140
Oh, so he wasn't hacked after all.

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,460
"Originally claimed
his account had been hacked,

26

27
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,660
"with a 15-year-old girl."

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,700
So tweeting dick photos
is correspondence now, is it?

29
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,740
"Departure triggers a by-election

30
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,020
"in his Stentonford and Hersham
constituency."

31
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,500
Well, you get to use
the Gladwell stuff.

32
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,580
Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,820
Bump it all up to
the top of the monologue.

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,500
Anyone seen Jamie?

35
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,500
PHONE DIALLING

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Rach?

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,660
'You really shouldn't be
calling me any more.

38
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,380
'You need to sort yourself out.'

39
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,860
I am.

40
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,380
'Focus on Waldo,
that's going well for you.'

41
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,740
But it is not...

42
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,500
'He's a hit, Jamie.'

43
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,020
"He." Not me, "he".

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,660
'Just do your show.'

45
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,500
I will. I mean, hon,
if you'd just...

46
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,740
PHONE CUTS OFF

47
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,300
(KNOCKING) Jamie?

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,060
Jamie, hurry up.

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,580
What do you know about
Stentonford and Hersham?

50
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,420
Safe Tory seat.

51
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,740
So, realistically, I know there's
not much of a chance, but...

52
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,660
So, it's a stepping stone for you?

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,140
Yes.

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,860
Obviously, I wouldn't say
that outside of this room,

55
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,940
but, well,
you want me to be honest.

56
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,500
There's no point in pretending.

57
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,060
Is there anything in your past that
might conceivably cause problems?

58
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,340
No.

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,340
Except...

60
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,940
I did commit a series
of murders in Huddersfield

61
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,940
between 1999 and 2003.

62
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,540
But apart from that...

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,780
Well, thank you, Gwendolyn.

64
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,740
If you could leave via that door.

65
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,500
Oh, that door?

66
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,540
We like to keep
the candidates separate.

67
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,100
Right, yes.

68
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,300
(MUTTERS) Idiot. Idiot!

69
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,380
Shamed super groomer and all-round
pillock of the community

70
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,500
Jason Gladwell
has resigned as an MP,

71
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,180
saying he could no longer
maintain his position.

72
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,460
That position, presumably,
being hunched over

73
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,660
wanking madly at school kids.

74
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,260
'A pal of Gladwell said...'

75
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,100
You ready?

76
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,460
Uh-huh.

77
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,540
How old the girl wasn't.

78
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,140
That's the sort of feeble excuse

79
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,860
'only a naive school kid
would swallow -

80
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,780
'which, presumably, was the idea.

81
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,940
'Anyway, the bad news is
he's resigned in disgrace.'

82
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,020
The good news is he's now
free to pursue a full-time career

83
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,660
in the disgraced paedophile
industry.

84
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,300
LAUGHTER

85
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,860
Personally, I don't understand
why anyone's surprised...

86
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,260
Um, small change to the intro.

87
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,220
What?

88
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,940
Nothing huge, Conor wanted the Jacko
gag for the monologue, so...

89
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,420
That was my bit.

90
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,660
There is the Chancellor stuff,
you could use that.

91
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,020
Bit politics.

92
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,860
You can do politics.

93
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,420
I do piss-taking.

94
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,500
Go be Waldo.

95
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,740
Yes, commander.

96
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,660
'R Kelly believed he could fly,

97
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,020
'and Michael Jackson believed
that his doctor was qualified...'

(DEEP VOICE) Big ball
blue bear bollocks.

99
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,860
And now it's time
for our final visit

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,300
to the world of educational
children's programming

101
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,860
courtesy of everyone's favourite,

102
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,300
and only occasionally inappropriate
cool kids' TV character,

103
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,660
Waldo.

104
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,140
Whose mum's in tonight, apparently.

105
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,940
Waldo, who have you had
in your cave this week?

106
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,300
Well, Conor,
in my big pink cave this week

107
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,300
I had former Minister
for Culture Liam Monroe.

108
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,220
Oh, he's quite handsome, isn't he?

109
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,500
I was hoping he'd nosh me off!

110
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,300
Want to see how it panned out?

111
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,940
I think we should.

112
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,300
Run VT!

113
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,060
APPLAUSE

114
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,820
LAUGHTER

115
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,580
Hey, everybody!

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,580
It's Waldo time!

117
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,060
Yeah!

118
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,580
Cool! Cool!

119
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,580
Waldo-rrific!

120
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,940
Ha-ha-ha!

121
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:23,460
Hey, kids,
my guest this week is Mr Monroe.

122
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,020
Hello, Mr Monroe.

123
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,420
Hello, Waldo.

124
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,500
Mr Monroe is a politician.

125
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,140
So, what is a politician, Mr Monroe?

126
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,020
Well, a politician is someone

127
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,740
who tries to make the
world a fairer place.

128
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,300
Like Batman.

129
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,220
Not exactly like Batman.

130
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,100
Do you beat people up?

131
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,500
No, I don't beat people up.

132
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,060
Oh, you're a pussy then?

133
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,860
Well, I'm not sure
I know exactly what...

134
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,580
You don't know what pussy is?

135
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,940
LAUGHTER

136
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,660
OK, this is clearly
some kind of joke.

137
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,300
No joke, sorry, let's move on.

138
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,580
Friends again?

139

140
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,660
Oh, hello, mate, great show.

141
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,780
Well done, really good.

142
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,060
So, we'll bring him over.

143
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,860
You go and get him,
I'll explain about...

144
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,660
'Now, he comes across...'

145
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,020
Jamie!

146
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
(WALDO'S VOICE)
What you want, Miss Tamsin?

147
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,220
Behind me, man in glasses
talking to Jack Napier.

148
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:28,940
Jack freaks me out.

149
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,300
Yeah, ditto,

150
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,500
but he owns the company
and the man he's with is important

151
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,300
and wants to talk to you.

(SIGHS)

153
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,140
He's from the channel.

154
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,660
Go on.

155
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,420
'Honestly, all I'm saying...'

156
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,860
'Is he shy?'

157
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,100
'No, all I'm saying is
he's a terrific guy...'

159
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,420
How do you do?

160

Jim, Jack, James.

Jamie.

162
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,580
Jim was just talking about Waldo.

163
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,420
Yeah. Liam Monroe
has lodged a complaint.

164
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,860
Toys out the pram.

165
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,220
And that's...?

166
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,580
Good press.

167
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,020
It's so tough to get
a breakthrough these days,

168
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,500
but when it does,
well, it's just fantastic.

169
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,940
It's fantastic the way Waldo puts
the piss up Monroe.

170
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,380
You know, all those twats,
it's punk, it's... it's...

171
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,580
'Jack?'

172
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,980
Excuse me.

173
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,740
Well, Twitter can't get
enough of Waldo, loves him.

174
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,220
Look, I know the show's
coming back again next year,

175
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,820
but we want to see more of Waldo.

176
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,220
They want to do a pilot.

177
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,140
A Waldo pilot?

178
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,300
Yeah. I mean, how does that sound?

179
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,500
Yeah. Sounds good.

180
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,700
Sounds stormin' Norman,
fucking stormin'.

181
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,180
Going to give it to 'em.

182
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,820
PHONE BEEPS

183
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,780
But look, we can't do sketches
without Waldo.

184
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,780
It's a Waldo pilot,
it's a Waldo show,

185
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,380
it's got to be Waldo, Waldo, Waldo.

186
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,140
Realistically, there isn't
the budget for other animations.

187
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,300
I mean live action,
other characters I can do.

188
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,220
What about the Brown Knight?

189
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,780
What, the crap crusader?

190
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,740
We can look into the Brown Knight.

191
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,340
But right now
let's find more Waldo ideas.

192
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:20,300
The problem is, any guests
we book will be in on it.

193
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,660
They know that Waldo's a joke,
the surprise is gone.

194
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,580
So, we think round that.

195
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,260
(WALD) Hey, boys and girls!
It's Waldo time!

196
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,420
Yeah! Ha-ha!

197
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,300
He's awesome, isn't he?

198
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,060
I mean, look - sod name in lights,
you're an app now, my brother.

199
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,300
All right, Sara? How's the
think tanking going, good shit?

200
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,300
Um, yeah, yeah,
we're making headway.

201
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,780
Good.

202
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,140
I see our friend Monroe
is in the news again,

203
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,860
running in
the Stentonford by-election.

204
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,460
We should get Waldo down there.

205
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,740
Hey, that's not a bad idea,
actually.

206
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,940
We get a van with a screen with
the image of Waldo on the side.

207
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,140
Like it.

208
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,380
And then, when Monroe's
doing a meet and greet,

209
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,220
we just turn up
and just get under his skin.

210
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,620
I love that, I love it.

211
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,340
We've done Monroe.

212
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,700
But it was a great bit.

213
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:09,140
I'm not dumb or clever enough
to be political...

214
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,500
Why don't we get Waldo
to stand for the by-election?

215
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,580
Get people to vote for him?

216
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,780
He's not real.

217
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,300
But people have stood as
fictional characters before.

218
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,580
Do you think Screaming
Lord Sutch was his real name?

219
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,860
We just put "commonly known as"
on the ballot.

220
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,500
No-one's actually going to vote
for him, that's not the point.

221
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,580
The point is, we get to hang around,
we're there for the count.

222
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,260
Well, go on then, Sara,
whack it up there.

223
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:05,140
'He's with a mum and baby group.'

224
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,820
OK. Going live
in five... four... three two...

225
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,500
'Thank you so much
for joining me this morning.'

226
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,140
It's been incredibly informative

227
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,340
and I think we should have a little
round of applause for the children,

228
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,300
who were fantastic.

229
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,820
Thank you, Naomi.

230
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,700

Oh. I like your trainers, man!

234
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,660
I'd wear trainers myself
but I can't cos I haven't got feet.

235

they were breastfeeding?

241

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,620
Because I am that.

325
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,740
What? You're that thing?

326
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,180
Waldo's not a thing, he's a bear.

327
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,460
Liam Monroe calls him worse.
Nice work there, by the way.

328
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,980
Yeah, well. It's dick jokes
at his expense basically.

329
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,100
Another one?

330
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,540
OK. One.

331
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,940
The way you describe it, it's like
you're doing this for a showreel...

332
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,980
No...

333
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,700
like this place is the equivalent
of a walk-on in a sketch show...

334
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
Shh!

335
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,420
But your party leader has to show
up because it's a... mid-thing...

336
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,620
Midterm by-election.

337
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,660
Terminology tits.

338
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,860
You are 12!

339
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,820
So because leaderballs is there,

340
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,860
suddenly it's walk-on
in a Ricky Gervais sketch show

341
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,220
so it's good exposure.

342
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,700
You're not going to win,
you know you're not going to win...

343
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,740
Come on, shh.

344
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,780
You're not going to win though.

345
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,820
Of course not.

346
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,020
So, why not be honest?

347
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,060
Say, "You arseholes aren't
going to vote for me,

348
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,500
"so here's what I think anyway."?

349
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,460
It doesn't work like that.

350
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,940
Nothing does, that's why
everything's bollocksed.

351
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,180
You're angry, for someone
who's doing well.

352
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,180
I'm the voice of a blue bear...

353
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,820
if that's, "doing well,"
then we are doomed!

354
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,020
I can't see!

355
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,540
Hang on, there's a thing.

356
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,380
Have you had a fox in here or do you
live like a 14-year-old?

357
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,140
Well, don't get too excited,
I'm not sleeping in it.

358
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,420
Shit, really?

360
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,500
Sorry?

361
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,340
You're amazing?

362
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,940
Oh, thank you!

364
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,380

Nothing.

366
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,260
Are you sure?

367
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,700
It's just...

368
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,420
I haven't been happy in a while...

369
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,220
and this is good, you know?

370
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
Hm.

371
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:30,220

Yes! (GIGGLES)

Oh, hello, I'm Mr Monroe.

I met Waldo last night.

388
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:00,420
Jamie, the guy who plays him.

389
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,540
He's fun.

390
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,140
Fun?

391
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,180
Mmm-hmm.

392
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,740
Did you tell him anything
about our campaign?

393
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,300
Not really.

394
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,940
Not really or no?

395
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,700
Er, not really.

396
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,020
Look, he's OK.

397
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:18,220
He's a comedian -

398
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:20,660
he's mocking Monroe now,
it'll be you next.

399
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,660
His act is all f-this
and penis jokes.

400
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
But...

401
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,580
Don't see him again.

402
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,260
OK. Job done till

They've asked Waldo
to join the panel.

405
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,460
Oh, come on. It's my nightmare,
going on Question Time.

It's students, you'll walk it.

serious questions...

No-one wants you to!
You're the comic relief, lighten up.

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,260
Erm, just have a look. I'm sure
you'll find lots in there...

I thought we were going to...?

Sorry - I've had a tough day...

417
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,380
Right. Not even one?

418
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,860

Well, what about tomorrow?

Look, I can't, when this
is happening, I can't see you.

What do you mean?

00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,700
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,240
Do they think that
looks like Question Time?

424
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
Yeah. It looks politicsy.

425
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,920
Check the host.

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Jailbait Dimbleby.

427
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,400
When it comes to addiction
and addicts, we should sympathise,

428
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,560
but we shouldn't patronise.

429
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,960
You know, serious drug use is
a criminal offence, that is

430
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,560
committed voluntarily
and for pleasure...

AUDIENCE MUTTERS MUTINOUSLY

432
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,040

433
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,440
Waldo, what do you think?

434
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,080
Mr Monroe, are you addicted?

435
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,840
No.

436
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,840

I think we have to ask ourselves...

439
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,520
I think we have to ask ourselves,
what is this for?

440
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:05,440
And why do we waste our time with
animated trivialities like him?

Why? I mean why?

444
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,440
(ON A LOOP) I mean why? I mean why?

445
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,960
I mean why? I mean why?

446
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,440
This is just the kind of thing...
rather than see you laugh...

447
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,000
They laugh at you, Limbo.

448
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,480
You laugh, you're laughing
at someone who won't engage.

449
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,960
Who is scared to engage, who
hides behind a children's cartoon.

450
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,600
Who you calling a kiddy toon, fool?

451
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,440
I'm... I'm... I'm
speaking about James Salter.

452
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,720
Hm?

453
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,480
Don't worry about it.

454
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,560
That's your name, isn't it?

455
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,080
James Salter, this is the man
who's behind all this.

456
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,000
He's 33 years old,

457
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,840
a man whose career can be summed up
surprisingly quickly.

458
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,360
You were in a sketch troupe

459
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,760
that enjoyed minor success about
six years ago,

460
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,840
and the others moved on to
better things,

461
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
but your main achievement seems to
have been playing

462
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,280
the part of a corn on the cob

463
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:02,400
in a high-interest personal
loan commercial.

464
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,720
LAUGHTER

465
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,560
I notice you keep that
pretty quiet.

466
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,760
And now of course operating
this sort of teddy bear thing.

467
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,600
Which by the way is easier than it
looks. Anyone could do it.

468
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,080
See, this is... this is the thing.
It's easy, what he does.

469
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
He mocks.

470
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,080
And when he can't
think of an authentic joke,

471
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,920
which is actually quite often,
he just swears.

472
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,040
I think that this puppet's
inclusion on this panel debases the

473
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:34,120
process of debate, and smothers any
meaningful discussion of the issues.

474
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,720
So I return to my original question,
is that really what this is for?

475
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,920
He has nothing to offer
and he has nothing to say.

476
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,560
Prove me wrong. Hm?

477
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,680
Speak, Waldo.

478
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,880
Please. Come on. Speak up.

479
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,480
There you see, nothing.

480
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,560
Oh, go fuck yourself.

481
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,680
LAUGHTER

482
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,440
It's more swearing.

483
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,760
You're a joke.

484
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
You look less human than I do

485
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,160
and I'm a made-up bear with
a turquoise cock.

486
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
LAUGHTER

487
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,480
What are you? You're just an old
attitude with new hair.

488
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,360
Assuming you're my superior because
I'm not taking you seriously?

489
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,720
No-one takes you seriously,
that's why no-one votes.

490
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,040
The vast majority do vote.

491
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
It's bullshit.

492
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Surely this is enough?

493
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,840
You think you deserve respect.

494
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,920
Just common courtesy.

495
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,360
Because you went to public school

496
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,560
and believed you were
entitled to everything.

497
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,280
Perhaps we could get back...

498
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,640
Ad hominem nonsense...

499
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,800
Gwendolyn Harris...

500
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,840
Something's got to change. No-one
trusts you lot cos they know

501
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,560
you don't give a shit about anything
outside your bubble.

502
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,280
What about your mate Gladwell,
the kiddy-flasher?

503
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,040
You knew him for 20 years,
did you not know what he was like?

504
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,280
No, of course not.

505
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,560
Yeah, cos you're all just front,
like him, sly and pretending,

506
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,560
and in that way you're all the same.

507
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,320
Gwendolyn Harris,
is all of politics a waste of time?

508
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
Well, of course I think no...

509
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
Oh, shut up, you're worse!

510
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,640
Seriously, she's faker than him.

511
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,280
For once I agree with
Liam Monroe in that this...

512
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:05,720
Are you going to win?

513
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,920
Doesn't get us anywhere and
there's no point in us continuing...

514
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
Tell them why you're here.

515
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,920
If we can't have anything
resembling a deba...

516
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,000
Tell them why you're here.

517
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,280
She's here to build a showreel.

518
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
I'm not kidding, that's literally
it.

519
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,040
Knows she's not going to win.
This is all experience,

520
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
to get on telly.

521
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,960
She actually gives less of a shit
about anyone round here than

522
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,320
he does, because he'll actually
have to represent you.

523
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,560
Am I wrong?

524
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,560
A career politician.
Someone else less real than me,

525
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,840
and I can do this.

526
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,160
LAUGHTER AND WHOOPING

527
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,920
Can I just make
a couple of points?

528
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,640
Oh, shut up, you pebble.

529
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,320
What is this for? That's what you
wanted to know, Mr Monroe.

530
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,320
And the truth is, none of us
know any more, thanks to you.

531
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,560
What are you for? What are you for?

532
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,320
Thank you and goodnight.

533
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,640
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

Jamie?

537
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,120
Jack's here. He wants to see us.

538
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,480
You can't avoid it.

539
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,080
Get dressed, he'll meet us outside.

You are everywhere, my son.

Twitter, the news...
Have you seen the poll?

You're in third place, mate.

You overtook that Lib Dem prick...

Yeah, well, he's a glass of water.

561

This is an opportunity, Jamie.

562
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
He knows my name now.

563
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,840
We could really do something here.

564
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
You know, everyone's pissed
with the status quo.

565
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,040
And Waldo gives that a voice.

566
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,840
Waldo's a bear. A blue bear.

567
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,400
Tell him, Tams.

568
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,640
We've been asked on Consensus.

569
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,080
It's a ten-minute one-to-one
interview with Phillip Crane.

570
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,200
Pitbull Crane?

571
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,280
Big guns for big guns.

572
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,560
Hello? I'm not a politician, OK?
I don't want to be a politician.

573
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,920
We know that you hate politics.

574
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,480
I don't hate them,
I'm just not interested in them.

575
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,200
You don't need to be
interested in them.

576
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,520
You just need to be Waldo.

577
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,520
And when Crane asks something tricky
and I look stupid

578
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,440
because I don't know how to answer?

579
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,520
You'll know the answer.

580
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,280
Because you have a producer.

581
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,920
Look, I can tell you what to say.

582
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,680
I can live Google any facts,
give you stats, quotes,

583
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
whatever else you need.

584
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,120
So you've got a safety
net for the concrete stuff

585
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,520
and the rest is Waldo
and you can do that in your sleep.

586
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,560
You'll piss all over Crane.

587
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,640
He'll know there's a team around me,
he'll see it.

588
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:17,240
Yeah good. I hope he does.
I hope he points a camera at it.

589
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,320
All the other MPs have got teams,
we're just more honest about it.

590
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,800
Now come on. What d'you say? Eh?

591
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,600
Jamie! Jamie!

592
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,960
Why would I want to do this?

593
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,880
Look, the world is knackered
and you can do something about it.

594
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,360
I don't know what you're on about.

595
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,280
Waldo has got the attention
of the young, and the young don't

596
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
give a shit about anything
except trainers and pirating films.

597
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,040
Do you have any other astounding
theories about young people?

598
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,680
Yeah, yeah I do actually.
Look, they care about Waldo.

599
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,000
They'll vote for Waldo.

600
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,480
The video was a hit for a reason.

601
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,800
The video's embarrassing.
I'm embarrassed by it.

602
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,720
I was lashing out.
I wasn't even articulate -

603
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,920
Doesn't matter.
Or funny, which is almost worse.

604
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,200
We can build on that.

605
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,280
Waldo's not real.

606
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,080
Exactly! That's what you said that
really hit home. He's not real,

607
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,640
but he's realer than all the others.

608
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,360
He doesn't stand for anything.

609
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,760
Yeah, well, at least
he doesn't pretend to.

610
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,280
Look we... we don't need politicians,

611
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,120
we've all got iPhones
and computers, right?

612
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,680
So any decision that has to be made,
any policy, we just put it online.

613
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,440
Let the people vote thumbs up,
thumbs down, the majority wins.

614
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,320
That's a democracy. That's a...
that's an actual democracy.

615
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,320
So's YouTube and I don't know
if you've seen it but the most

616
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,360
popular video is a dog farting
the theme tune to Happy Days.

617
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,400
Well, today it's Waldo.

618
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,960
No. It's still the dog.

619
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,600
Listen, can you imagine all
the things we can change

620
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,640
if we fuck the politicians
out the equation?

621
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,120
I've said what I've said
and now I'm shutting this door.

622
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Do you know who owns Waldo?

623
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,400
I do, I own the rights.

624
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,280
He's my character.

625
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,880
Yeah, written for my show.

626
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,640
You're too frightened to take to
the next level. Fine. I understand.

627
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,520
But also, fuck off!

628
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,600
And watch me fly.

629
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,920
You own Waldo, you can't be Waldo.

630
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,120
(MIMICS WALDO) Eh, Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, what's 'appenin, eh?

631
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,600
Pretty close, I'd say.

632
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,010
What's happenin'? Ahh!

633
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:45,850
Waldorific, yeah! Yeah!

634
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:47,090
Why is it going off left again?

635
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,930
Because the...

636
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,890
I know! I've got my...

637
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,170
Put your thumb in the white thing.

638
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,130
I got that. In there? OK.

639
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,770
That's not how that works.

640
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,090
First tonight, a figure -
or more accurately a character -

641
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,810
who's been causing an upset
in the Stentonford by-election.

642
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:14,090
Unlike the other candidates,
he has no party affiliation.

643
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:15,930
He doesn't even have a surname.

644
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,370
He is Waldo, a few weeks ago just
a cult character in a comedy show.

645
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,010
Today, an official
mascot for protest voters.

646
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,330
Vote Waldo.

647
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,530
Cartoons don't play by the rules
and Waldo's open disdain

648
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,330
for his opponents
has clearly struck a chord.

649
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:36,650
Waldo, as a mascot
for the disenfranchised, aren't you

650
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,930
ultimately neutralizing seriously
effective dissent?

651
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,010
Can I have subtitles for Mr Crane,
please?

652
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,450
By encouraging people not to care,
you're actively dangerous.

653
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,450
Dangerous? You think
the public can't be trusted?

654
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,530
No.

655
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,010
Isn't that basically you
calling them twats?

656
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,010
No, I...

657
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,090
Bell-ends then?

658
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,650
Did you come for a discussion
or...

659
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:57,890
You're snooty for a glorified
Punch And Judy man, Phil.

660
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:00,770
You know you're gonna get your best
ratings in months cos I'm here.

661
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:03,530
To even get close to the figures
I'm gonna pull in for you tonight,

662
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,370
you'd have to fuck a prawn sandwich
live on air.

663
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,010
Make a nice prawn cocktail.

664
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,170
Could we make a serious
political point that is...

665
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,090
I've got one big blue point
to make, fool.

666
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,890
Would you like to have a look at it?

667
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,930
Oh, God. Thank you.

668
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,730
Great work tonight. Look at... Look
at this, look at this.

669
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:19,890
It's The Waldo polling app.
Now, this can pinpoint you with GPS

670
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,730
so that when you're at a polling
station,

671
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,410
it unlocks loads of free shit, look.

672
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,730
Thanks for voting, dickhead!

673
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,290
Thanks for voting, dickhead!

674
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,450
It's good, isn't it?

675
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,890
Who's this guy we're meeting?

676
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:33,970
I dunno. But he's from Washington
and he's got my restricted number.

677
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:39,890
Jeff Carter, from the agency.

678
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:40,530
Hey. Hey.

679
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,810
And I'll leap right in.

680
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,410
I think what you're doing
with Waldo is fascinating.

681
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,730
From "the agency"?

682
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:49,370
Yeah, listen. Waldo may be
the perfect political figurehead.

683
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:50,890
Waldo The Bear.

684
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,930
The bear, people like.
The fact he's a bear is an assist.

685
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:54,370
An assist?

686
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,450
It helps.

687
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:57,650
Right. You look at human
politicians,

688
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:00,530
you're instinctively like,
"brrrr" - uncanny, right?

689
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,730
Like the girls in porn.

690
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,210
You know something's wrong,
cos why else are they doing it?

691
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,930
It's usually daddy issues, eh?

692
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,210
Just like politics.
Waldo bypasses that.

693
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,730
You already know he's not real,
so no personal flaws.

694
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:12,170
I'm a person.

695
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:14,090
With respect, Waldo's more than you.

696
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:17,730
He's a team, and you're open
about that, which is fantastic.

697
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,690
The honesty thing works.

698
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,930
Waldo is a construct
people not just accept but embrace.

699
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,890
At the moment he's anti-politics,

700
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:28,930
which is a political stance itself,
right?

701
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,050
But he could deliver any brand
of political content,

702
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:34,730
minus the potential downsides
of a human messenger.

703
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:38,650
In a debate, your team could Google
every word the other guy says,

704
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,650
then let Waldo hit him
with debunk stats

705
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,810
and spit a Twitter-ready
zinger into the next sentence.

706
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,170
He's the perfect assassin.

707
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,890
We won't win, though.

708
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,570
You guys are so British.

709
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:57,730
No, of course he won't win. You
started out too coarse off the bat.

710
00:34:57,770 --> 00:35:00,930
There's no substantial basis
to what you offer, and the whole

711
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:05,370
nihilist "democracy sucks" thing,
yeah, is kind of wack-a-doo,

712
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,810
but with a targeted, hopeful
message, which we can provide,

713
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:13,010
energising the disenfranchised
without spooking the middle

714
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:17,450
via your new platform... You got
a global political-entertainment

715
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,010
product people actually want.

716
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,370
You could roll this out worldwide.

717
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,290
Like Pringles.

718
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,690
Absolutely.

719
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,090
It's, er... It's interesting stuff
though.

720
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,930
When you're done with Stentonford,

721
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,530
there may be an opportunity
in South America.

722
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,170
Se puede hablar espanol?

723
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:43,570
Vivi en Madrid tres anos.

724
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,450
Excelente.

725
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,650
What?

726
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,450
He's not coming.

727
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,090
But he's the party leader!

728
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,210
It's too toxic.

729
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,210
(TV) Meanwhile,
as support for Gwendolyn Harris

730
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,450
appears to be dwindling,

731
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:23,370
Labour denies the party is losing
faith in their young candidate.

732
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:26,010
But Miss Harris spent most of
the day locked in crisis talks

733
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,290
at party headqu...

734
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:35,250
In the Stentonford by-election,
Waldo the cartoon bear continues...

735
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,970
Did you see Gwendolyn Harris
yesterday?

736
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,050
She looks like she's been poisoned.

737
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,450
Because he's gonna overtake her.

738
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,810
We're still way ahead.

739
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:48,170
If that thing is the main opposition
then the whole system looks absurd.

740
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:53,410
Which it may well be.

741
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,850
But it built these roads.

742
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,970
KNOCK AT DOOR

743
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,810
Just come in, Roy.

744
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,810
I'm sorry, OK?

745
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,730
It was wrong to speak to you
like that and...

746
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:19,170
After the campaign,
I would've called you.

747
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,450
After the campaign!

748
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,610
All you've done
is strengthen Monroe.

749
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,370
You won't win either, but I was
at least attempting to represent...

750
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:32,370
Well I don't know!
Not just "bollocks to everything".

751
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:35,050
If you were preaching revolution,
well that'd be something,

752
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:38,130
but you're not because that would
require courage and a mindset.

753
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,770
And what have you got?

754
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,530
Who are you?

755
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,570
What are you for?

756
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,810
Morning.

757
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,570
So, final push.

758
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:08,250
You remind everyone
that's got the app

759
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:12,010
that if they recommend it to a friend
it unlocks a little fez for Waldo.

760
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,130
We're here.

761
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,290
Attention, shoppers.

762
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:21,730
I'm here to ask you an important
favour. Gather round.

763
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,890
Come over here and listen.

764
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:29,530
Don't vote for me. I'm an insult.

765
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,090
Seriously.

766
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:34,090
Vote for Monroe or Harris
or, I dunno, UKIP,

767
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,930
or even that Lib Dem guy.

768
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,570
He's a prick!

769
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,210
Seriously, only an arsehole
would actually vote for me.

770
00:38:41,370 --> 00:38:42,370
What is this? Irony?

771
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,090
I'm worse than a wasted vote.

772
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:45,850
He's from the Harris campaign.

773
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:48,090
I mean it, you idiots!
Don't vote for me!

774
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,290
Don't vote for me!
Don't vote for me!

775
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,210
Don't vote for me!

776
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,970
Don't vmmmf!

777
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:57,450
Shut up.

778
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,370
No. Don't boo him,
he's right! He's right!

779
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,570
What are you doing?

780
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,010
Resigning.

781
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,250
Jamie!

782
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:05,450
Look! It's me, I'm Waldo.

783
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,650
This guy, whoever this guy is,
he's a hero.

784
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:11,010
You should throw stuff at Waldo,
he's bad bloody news.

785
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:11,210
He's funny!

786
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,370
He's not.

787
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,930
Don't listen to that man,
he's a lesbian. Ahh!

788
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:18,570
So remember, the polls are open,
and if you've got my app, you can

789
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:21,930
unlock new stuff like catchphrases
and a little hat 'n' that.

790
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:26,290
Only an idiot wouldn't vote for me
so question the status quo!

791
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,570
Kill it! Kill it!

792
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,450
Kick them where it hurts.

793
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:32,090
The first man to hit him
gets 500 quid!

794
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,570
Yeah, that's right. Knock him down.
Knock him down.

795
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,010
Smash it!

796
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:39,170
Yeah! Yeah!

797
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,530
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah...
