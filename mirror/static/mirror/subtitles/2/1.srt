First family outing after Jack died.

and no-one saying anything.

56
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,000
Mum drove home, that was a first.
When I came down the next morning,

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,560
all Jack's photos were gone from that
wall.

58
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,560
She put them in the attic.

59
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,120
That's how she dealt with stuff.

60
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,560
And then when Dad died,
up went his photos.

61
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,360
She just left this one here.

62
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,040
Her only boy,
giving her a fake smile.

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,480
She didn't know it was fake.

64
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,320
Maybe that makes it worse.

65
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,320

70
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,400
No, it's all right.

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,160

72
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,120

No, no, it's fine.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll drive all the way there
alone...

85
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,760
pick the car up alone...
drive all the way back alone...

86

I'm just scared something's
happened to him.

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,160
Nothing's happened.

104
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,760
But something could've happened.

105
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,560
Look, sweetheart,
nothing's happened,

you're just working yourself up,
imagining the worst possible thing,

stuck somewhere with no reception.

It's not real, is it?

110
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,400
At Mark's wake,
I sat there thinking it's not real.

111

The people didn't look real,
their voices weren't real.

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,340
You talk to it?

138
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,740
You type messages in, like an e-mail,

139
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,260
and then it talks back to you,
just like he would.

142
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,380
You give it someone's name.

143
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,860
It goes back and reads through all
the things they've ever said online,

their Facebook updates,
their Tweets, anything public.

145
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,580
I just gave it Ash's name.

It's so clever.

00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,580
It's... sick. It's sick!

148
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,180
Just say hello to it.
If you like it,

149
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,580
you then give it access
to his private emails.

150
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,380

Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I just, I
just... I had a bad one earlier.

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,460
D'you want me to come and visit?
I'm going to come and visit.

'No, it's OK, really, I'm...'

I'm going to come and see you.

No. No, don't.

I sound like a right sick fuck.'

Yeah. Yeah. In a good way.

204
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,020
So I went in,
after all your persuasion,

205
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,700
and then like straightaway I got a
spine of a sea anemone or something

206
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,380
stuck in my foot, and you threw
a jeb thinking it was poisonous.

'Oh, OK, so I "threw a jeb".'

210
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,300
Yeah, and you were looking
in a guidebook, trying to figure out

211
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,740
if there were any poisonous
sea creatures in Greece,

212
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,900
when this local guy
comes over and says,

he wasn't French, obviously.

I remember you brought me up here
when we first met your mum.

219
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,220
We'd been at hers all weekend

220
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,660
and you could tell
I needed some headspace.

221
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,500
You were good like that.

222
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,300
'You speak about me
like I'm not here.'

00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,420
Mm.

226
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,900

you said it was just a big gap.

'I Tweeted that, too.'

232
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Yeah, I remember
the roaming charges.

233
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,900

and cop a load of this.

'Yeah. Mainly just green, isn't it?'

from here did it alone. Nice.'

'Sort of. Shouldn't I have?'

Stops the synthetic muscle

Smells almost...

309
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
like marshmallow.

310
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,600
You can eat it if you like.
It's non-toxic.

Mm-hm, the whole lot.

315
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,360

324
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,480
Don't switch the bathroom light on.

You could've left me some clothes.

333
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,720
I mean, talk about an undignified
entrance.

334
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,320
That's a bit creepy.
What you're doing.

335
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,480
Is there at least a towel?
I'm dripping everywhere.

336
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,680
Hello?

337

Would you like me
to put some food on?

340
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,200
Do you eat?

341
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,440
No.

342
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,960
I mean, I don't need to.

343
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
I can chew and swallow,
if that makes it easier?

Don't worry about it, it's fine.

345
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,160
I need a drink.

346
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,240
Are you sure that's...?

347
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,240
I know, I'm not supposed to.
It won't kill us.

Fuck the official advice.
It's one night.

350
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,960
You look well.

351
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,960
Well, I am young.

352
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,680
I mean... You look like him
on a good day.

353
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,680
The photos we keep
tend to be flattering.

354
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,600
I guess I wasn't any different.

355
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,480
You're so soft.

356
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,520
You're so smooth.
How are you so smooth?

357
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480
You've got pores and lines...

358
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,720
It's texture-mapping.

359
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,720
The really tiny details
are visual - 2D.

Here, try my fingertips.

361
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,560
See?

362
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,280
Weird.

363
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,560
Does it bother you?

364
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,800
No.

365
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,360
Yeah.

I missed you. I missed you so much!

368
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,720
Hey, don't cry.

369

Don't cry.

Come on then. Top off.

What's wrong?

372
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,880
He had a mole there.

373
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,280
Where?

374
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,400
There.

375
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,960
Hang on.

376
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,440
That's ridiculous.

377
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,720
That's completely stupid.

378
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,600
Hello?

379
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,880
Hi.

Your hand's on my tit.

381
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,640
You're doing wonders
for my self-esteem here.

382
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,520
There's no record of my sexual
response.

383
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,840
I didn't discuss
that side of things online.

384
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,440
But you have sexual responses.
I mean...

385
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,600
This works?

386
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh.

387
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,040
That, I can turn that on and off
pretty much instantly.

388
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,760
See?

389
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,560
I can do it again if you like.

390
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,480
Oh, oh, God. Oh, shit.

391
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,920
Should I stop?

392
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,760
No! No, it's really good.

393
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:44,360

394

What were you doing?

Nothing.

403
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,320
The way that your eyes were open,
it scared me.

404

You'd prefer if I closed them?

405

What, when you're sleeping?
Um, yeah?

406

I don't really need to sleep.

it's pretty strange.

getting used to it.

Which is good, you know, obviously,

because it's kept my mind
off everything, so...

Where's the toilet?

That was my sister.

You know her.

470
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,400
She said that I was...

471
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,000
She said that she was happy
that I'd moved on.

472
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,120
Moved on to what?

473
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,720
Is that not the sort of
thing I'd say?

474
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,720
I mean...

475
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,200
It is, isn't it?

00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,360

It's OK, I can do it. I can do it.

I can do it.

00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,160
Would you like me
to have sex with you?

490
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,280
Can you just go downstairs?

491
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,320
OK.

492
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,840
No! That's...

493
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,400
Ash would argue over that.

494
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,680
He wouldn't just leave
because I'd ordered him to.

495
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,480
OK.

496
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,760
What? N...

497
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,160
Ah, fucking hell!

498
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,480
Don't cry, darling.

499
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,840
Oh, don't! Just get out!
Get out!

500
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,480
Go on!

501
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,120
So you do want me to go?

502
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,240
Just get out! Get out! Get out!

503
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,040
Get out! Get out! Get out!

504
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,920
You're not enough of him!
You are nothing! You're nothing.

505
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Fight me.

506
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
I don't do that.

507
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,240
Fucking fight me! Hit me.

508
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Hit me. Hit me. Come on!

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,600
Why are you just standing
there taking this?

510
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,920
How can you take this?

511
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,360
Did I ever hit you?

512
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,720
N... No, of course you didn't

513
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,160
but you might've done if I done this.
Or this.

514
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,520
I don't... I don't know.

515
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,880
Maybe you would have. But you
wouldn't, would you? You wouldn't.

516
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,000
I could insult you.

517
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,280
What?

518
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,240
There's tons of invective
in the archive.

519
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,720
I like speaking my mind,
I could throw some of that at you.

520
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,400
Get out of this house.

521
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,880
(SIGHS)

522
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,160
What are you doing?

523
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,000
I can't go more than 25 metres
from my activation point.

524
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,520
What is that, a joke?

525
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,160
Look, I know it sounds mental.

526
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,560
Where's your activation point?

527
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,360
At the risk of blowing your mind...

528
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,480
it's where I was activated.

529
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,520
The bath.

530
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,080
I have to keep within a 25-metre
radius unless my administrator -

531
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,520
that's you - is with me.

532
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,240
Don't call me your administrator.

533
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,160
Why not?

534
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,080
Because...

535
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,840
It sounds sort of sexy.

536
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,520
(LAUGHS)

537
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,600
If you're laughing,
can I come back inside?

538
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,080
Feeling a bit...

539
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,200
ornamental out here.

540
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,880
SHOWER WATER RUNNING

541
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,400
Funny.

542
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,880
Can you put that down, please?

543
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,040
But it is funny.

544
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:52,960
Could you just put it down?

545
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,120
Come with me. We're going out.

546
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,440
♪ THE BEE GEES:
How Deep Is Your Love

547
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,480
Cheesy.

548
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,120
Come on.

549
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,000
Where are we going?

550
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,400
Just hurry up.

551
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,760
SEAGULLS SQUAWK

552
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,640
NO!

553
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:54,440
DON'T DO IT!

554
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,120
Seriously, don't do it.

555
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,960
I'm not going to.

556
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,280
OK.

557
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,400
See, he would have worked out
what was going on.

558
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,520
This wouldn't have ever happened,
but if it had, he would have

559
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,520
worked it out.

560
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,680
Sorry, hang on. That's a very
difficult sentence to process.

561
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:19,840
Jump.

562
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,320
What? Over there?

563
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,000
I never expressed suicidal thoughts,
or self-harm.

564
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,560
Yeah, well, you aren't you, are you?

565
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:31,200
That's another difficult one,
to be honest with you.

566
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,800
You're just a few ripples of you.
There's no history to you.

567
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,680
You're just a performance of stuff
that he performed without thinking,

568
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,080
and it's not enough.

569
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,720
Come on. I aim to please.

570
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,280
Aim to jump. Just do it.

571
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:46,200
OK.

572
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,840
If you're absolutely sure.

573
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,280
See, Ash would've been scared.

574
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,000
He wouldn't have just leapt off,
he would have been crying,

575
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,920
he would have been...

576
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,240
Oh.

577
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:01,240
Oh... Oh, God, no.

578
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,840
Please, I don't want to do it.

579
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,400
Please don't make me do it.

580
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,760
No. That's not fair.

581
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,360
No, I'm... I'm frightened, darling,
please...

582
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,560
Don't make me.

583
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,160
I don't want to die.
Oh, God, I don't want to die

584
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
No, that's not fair.

585
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,400
I'm frightened, I don't want to die.
Don't...

586
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,320
NO!!!!

587
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:39,960
One for you, one for me.

588
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,960
What?

589
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,040
We need another slice.

590
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,320
Why?

591
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,080
So I can take one upstairs.

592
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,920
It's not the weekend.

593
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,400
It is my birthday.

594
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,080
OK.

595
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,760
"Thanks, Mum."

596
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,800
Hey, Ash.

597
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,360
Hey. The birthday girl.

598
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,720
Just gonna come and hang out
for a bit.

599
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,480
OK. I wasn't doing anything.

600
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,280
I brought you some cake.

601
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,840
I know you don't eat anything.

602
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,520
I'm just using you as an excuse
so I can get an extra slice.

603
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,040
Devious.

604
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,240
Mum?

605
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,560
Mum!

606
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,600
Yeah, I'm just coming.

607
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,720
