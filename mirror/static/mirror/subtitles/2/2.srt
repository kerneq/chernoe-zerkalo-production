Hello.

00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,320
Can you help me?

12
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Do you know who I am? I... I...

13
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
I can't remember who I am.

Oh! Help!

26
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,160
Help me. He's got a gun! Help me!

27
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,360
Hey! We have to go!

28
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,280
Come on!

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720

Oh, my god!

31
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,600
Stay back!

32
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,080
Back! Get back!

33
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,760
Get back. Back!

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
There's a door round there.

40
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,760
It's locked.

41
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,760
You don't know that!

42
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
There's a keypad.

43
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,600
We should try it.

44
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,120
Get down! Anybody stands up,
they'll shoot their heads off.

45
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,760
He's trying to kill me!
What's going on?

46
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Shut up! I'm trying to think!

47
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,960
He can see you. Get back.

48
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,880
Oh, my god!
What's wrong with those people?!

49
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,400
Why aren't they helping us?
They're just watching...

50
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,760
Where the fuck have you been?

51
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,040
What?

52
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
Get that extinguisher.

53
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,480
(SCREAMS) I can't! I can't do it!

54
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
Get it. Get it now!

55
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,640
(PANTING) OK... OK... OK...
OK... OK...

56
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,040
Come on.

57
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,240
Quickly. Slide it to me.

58
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,320
Damien, if he climbs through, you
grab him and you grab his gun.

59
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,360
I can't...

60
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,160
You can.

61
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,240
He'll shoot me!

62
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,640
You have to!

63
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm going to smash the lock off that
door, you help him with gun guy.

64
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,920
He can't shoot all of us.
If he fires, he has to reload.

65
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,680
We either rush him or run, OK?

66
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,840
I can't do this!

67
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,800
We have no choice!

68
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Help him.

69
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,840
Urgh!

70
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,200
Damien!

71
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,440
Oh, my...

72
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
Get him!

73
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,440
PEOPLE LAUGH AND SHOUT

74
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Urgh! Urgh! Urgh!

75
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,680

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,840

Shh!

79
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,800

They like scaring people.

93
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,160
What?

94
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,920
OK. We have to run for that opening.

95
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,560
No, they'll see us.

96
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,800
If they're busy with him
we can lose the hunters, OK?

97
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,080
No.

98
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,440
You just stay with me. OK?

99
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,600
OK.

100
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
Ready... Come on...

101
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,230
Wait.

102
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,830
Wait!

103
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,950
The onlookers sometimes wait
in the windows, keeping lookout.

104
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,750
I'm pretty sure that's how they find
us. Through the cameras somehow.

105
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,110
Onlookers spot you and a few minutes
later the scary bastards turn up.

106
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,870
This is mad, this is just mad.

107
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:14,430
Hold it together and do
what I say or you'll get us killed.

108
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,670
I...

109
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:20,350
I woke up in this house and I don't
even know if it's my house.

110
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,310
I don't even know who I am.

111
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,830
You must know something.

112
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,390
Ah!

113
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,590
I think this is my daughter.

114
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,990
But you don't know?

115
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,070
She could be anywhere.

116
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:35,750
Maybe you tried to kill yourself.
Would that explain it?

117
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,030
There was pills.

118
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,310
I don't blame you.

119
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,990
Lots have tried that fun
fork in the road since it started.

120
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,030
Since what started?

121
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,230
You really don't know?

122
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,590
No.

123
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,350
There was a signal... Like pictures,
flashing pictures.

124
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,550
They just appeared on every TV,
every computer,

125
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:53,510
anything with a screen.

126
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,590
Argh!

127
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,870
Ugh! (PANTING)

128
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,750
I saw it. I saw it.

129
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,030
CAMERA APERTURE SOUNDS

130
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,110
Get down.

131
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,870
They did something to people.

132
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,110
Like, almost everybody just became
onlookers,

133
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,870
started watching, filming stuff,

134
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,830
like spectators who don't give a
shit about what happens.

135
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,350
That's, like, nine
out of ten people now.

136
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,710
But not us.

137
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,750
Some of us weren't affected.
I don't know why.

138
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,110
Like that man with the gun
and that woman.

139
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:28,150
I call them "hunters". You might've
noticed that's what they do.

140
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,110
They seemed normal, but they
realised

141
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,710
they could do what they wanted

142
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,150
and they started taking stuff,
nicking cars cos they could,

143
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:38,270
doing what they like and not just
with things, with people.

144
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,590
It got worse and worse.
And now they've got an audience.

145
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,990
So this... This thing on the TV,
the...

146
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,190
The signal.

147
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,630
That's what's making them act like
this?

148
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,830
I guess they were always like that
underneath.

149
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,590
Just needed the rules to change,
for no-one to intervene.

150
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,990
What we going to do?
What we going to do?

151
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,070
Do? Do nothing. We get out.

152
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,990
Where's "out"?

153
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,710
We're here.
We need to head south of here.

154
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,190
They've knocked the transmitters
out, it's OK there.

155
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,510
The TV transmitters, they carry it.

156
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,790
There's only one between us

157
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,590
and the safe zone and we're going to
knock it out. See, it's here.

158
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:11,710
White Bear.

159
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,630
What?

160
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,670
White Bear...

161
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,950
Uh! Ungh!

162
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,630
(DISTORTED VOICE) A picnic with my
two best friends.

163
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,390
Jesus, what is it with you?

164
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:39,190
White Bear, you said White Bear...

165
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,390
So?!

166
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,390
Look, whatever's wrong with you,
you have to keep it together. OK?

167
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,190
Listen to me! Don't go out there.

168
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,430
What's your problem?

169
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:52,870
Huh? You want something to look at?

170
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,870
Cos I'll give you something
to look at!

171
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,670
No, I want to talk to him.

172
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,230
I want to talk to you!

173
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:01,390
Ah!

174
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,670
It's not so funny now, is it?

175
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,150
Put it down.

176
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,910
I just want to see what
they're looking at.

177
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,830
I said put it down.

178
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,550
It's dangerous.
Their phones, they're dangerous.

179
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,190
It's the signal. The images are
on them, they're on the screen.

180
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,670
What?

181
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,670
Don't look at it!

182
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,710
Don't look at it.

183
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,670
'Jemima...'

184
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,830
No, no. This is all wrong.
This is all wrong!

185
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
They're coming. Run! Run!

186
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,790

188
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,230
Get in.

189
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,630
Get in. Come on.

190
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,630
Come on.

191
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,350
Come on, now! They're coming!
Quick.

192
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,630
Come on, hurry up. Get in.

193
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,390
SAW BUZZES

194
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,350
You nearly killed us back there.

195
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:24,110
Yeah, well, I wasn't expecting you
to be there, was I?

196
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,510
I just saved your lives.
A wee 'thank you' would be nice.

197
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,790
I should've just run yous over.

198
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,230
Who are you?

199
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,310
Who are you?

200
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,550
It's not a hard question, is it?

201
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,310
I know... I know you.

202
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,830
Do you? Well, where did we meet,
if you know me?

203
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,350
No. Didn't think so, yeah.

204
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,670
She's not in a good way.

205
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,430
Yeah, I'll say.

206
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,310
So what are yous doing out here
anyway?

207
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,070
Heading south.

208
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,390
That's not a good move.
It's all blocked up down there.

209
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,830
There's a transmitter there...

210
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,390
I don't think you understand.

211
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,390
When I said, "It's not a good move",

212
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,310
that means I'm not driving
you down there.

213
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,470
I know a safe place we can go.

214
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,310
The woods.

215
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,150
Your safe place is in the woods.

216
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,350
How'd you know that?

217
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,310
I don't... I don't know.

218
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,110
Christ, maybe you do know me.

219
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:28,750
Yeah, we pull up and we get out.

220
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,630
We talk. There's no-one chasing us.

221
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,990
Mystic Meg.

222
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,110
And then what happens?

223
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,350
We eat.

224
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,150
Told you. No bars.

225
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,710
They'll never find us here.

226
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,190
That your daughter?

227
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:58,950
Yeah, I think so.

228
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,550
Where is she?

229
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,910
I don't know.

230
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,270
What'd you do to your wrists?

231
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,710
Don't know.

232
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,590
History of mental illness?

233
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,910
Yeah, I bet you do. Lay money on it.

234
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,550
What about you?

235
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,670
What about me?

236
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,630
Mental illness, weaknesses...

237
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,470
Everyone's got weaknesses.

238
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:21,270
Yeah, you two have got more
that most, I'd say.

239
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:25,190
That's why you're on the receiving
end, you see. Vulnerable.

240
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,310
Receiving end of what?

241
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:31,750
This. Everything that's going on.
Easy pickings.

242
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,710
What's your weaknesses then?

243
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,110
My weaknesses?

244
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,870
Show you if you want.
You want to see it?

245
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,710
Wait there don't move.
You're going to like this.

246
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,910
Not a lot.

247
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,710
This better not be naturism.

248
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,910
Yeah, in your dreams.

249
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,990
Tada!

250
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,870
Run and I'll shoot you in the back.

251
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,430
Right, come over here.

252
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,470
Stand there.

253
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,390
You, here, put this on.

254
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:08,670
Put it on. Backwards,
so it covers your eyes.

255
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,070
Put your hands on her shoulders.
Keep them there.

256
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,790
You're her eyes now, all right?

257
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,550
And that is a shotgun, OK?

258
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,710
If I pull this trigger, it's going
to cut you, both in half.

259
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,510
So no funny business, all right?

260
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,990
Right, off you go.

261
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,230
Straight ahead.
Keep going through the trees.

262
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,510
Come on, pick up the pace.

263
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:43,390
Got a lovely
playground for you down there.

264
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,990
That's it, through here.

265
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:49,110
That's it, straight ahead.

266
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,350
Grab her!

267
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,630
Right, now take her balaclava off.

268
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,950
Get down there.

269

Oh, fuck.

Come on.

00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,670
Head towards that ladder.

272
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,830
Get down there.

273
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,590
Right, stop. Get on your knees, both
of you. Give me that bag.

274
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,670
Fucking bag.

275
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,910

Yeah.

282
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,350
I'm down in that wood spot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Easy.

283
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,590
I'll just lash them to a tree or
something like that.

284
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,830
Just hurry up and get down here.
I want to get started.

double trouble now, missus.

Get your hands through there.
Get your hands through there!

290
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,310
Right through.

291
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:39,950
Push your arms up. Push them!

292
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,470
Get them up there!

Are we going to put a show on for
these guys today, eh? (LAUGHS)

00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,670
For coming back for me.

311
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,110
I came back for this.

to shut it down before they get us.

What happens if we can't
shut it down?

317

We can.

318
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,990
How? Do we hack into it,
or something?

319
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,310
We don't hack anything.
We burn the control room down.

320
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,110
It's not hard, we just slosh a load
of petrol round, strike a light

a projectile, and we will step in

495
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,890
if she gets too close.
We're all equipped with tasers,

496
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:06,570
but then we're into story shutdown
and we've all wasted a day.

497
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,290
So it's best to keep your distance
at least three metres back.

498
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,170
You can use your camera zoom.

499
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,130
'Last, but not least,
enjoy yourself'.

500
00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:18,930
That's probably the most
important rule of all, OK?

501
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,090
Take photographs, run around through
the woods, but try and stay safe.

502
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,530
We'll be keeping an eye on you,
making sure you're all OK.

503
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,770
So get out there,

504
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:29,410
enjoy yourselves and let's make
this show happen, people! Come on!

505
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,690
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

506
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,290
THEY CHATTER

507
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:43,610
(GASPS) Ow!

508
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,650
Look, there she is.

509
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:14,050
'Don't know yet.
I'm kind of knackered.'

510
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,050
Me, too.

511
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:18,970
'She's just leaving her house now.
Two minutes tops.'

512
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,650
Right, you are. We're on.

513
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,730
HE WHISTLES

514
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,330
(GASPS AND PANTS)

515
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,290
Watch out!

516
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:55,570
He's trying to fucking kill me.
What's going on?

517
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,050
'Get that extinguisher.'

518
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,810
It's OK, they've gone.

519
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:02,570
THEY LAUGH

520
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,170
Convincing, eh?

521
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:09,970
HE WHISTLES

522
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:13,250
We got two minutes.

523
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,650
(SOBBING)

524
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,370
Help!

525
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,930
Help me!

526
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:33,890
AUDIENCE CHATTERS

527
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,690
'Early screamer.'

528
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,770
It's an early screamer tonight.
So keep the noise up and let's go!

529
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,530
CROWD CHEERS AND SHOUTS

530
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,490
(SCREAMS IN PAIN)

531
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,010
(GASPS)

532
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,250
(GASPS) Ow!

533
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:17,074
