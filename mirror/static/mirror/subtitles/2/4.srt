♪ When the snowman brings the snow

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,310
♪ Well, he just might like to know

♪ He's put a great, big smile

♪ You know that sweet
Santa Claus is on the way

♪ Well, I wish it could
be Christmas every day... ♪

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
♪.. When the kids start singing
and the band begins to play

♪ Oh, I wish it could be
Christmas every day. ♪

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,670
I was just getting into that.

13
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,190
What are you doing?

14
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,790
Roast potatoes.

15
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,230
We're doing Christmas.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,590
Christmas.

17
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,640
Christmas Day, December 25th.
You've heard of it?

18
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,880
No work today,
so the bottle's on the table.

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,310
I know we didn't have
decorations last year. But, er...

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,990
I couldn't find them last year.

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,510
They're only supposed to have
stored essentials here.

22
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,560
I think it's kind of adorable
someone thinks tinsel is essential.

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
I figured it'd be good for us
to have a meal, a drink, talk...

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,950
Good for you or me?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
Come on.
What has it been, five years?

26
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,030
How many sentences
have you said to me? Three?

27
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,030
I mean, I'm exaggerating...
a little.

28
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,070
But, come on, there
is a little bit of

29
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,430
a conversational
drought happening here.

30
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,630
My ears need water.

31
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,190
I'm not big on conversation.

32
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,910
~ Practice makes perfect.
~ Maybe I'll bore you.

33
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Buddy, look, at this point, being
bored by anything other than snow

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,030
would be a relief.

35
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,870
So come on.

36
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,910
Chitchat.

37
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,950
Conversate...

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,310
Something.

39
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,870
Come on, for me.

40
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,030
For Christmas.

41
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,080
What do you want to talk about?

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,150
Why are you here?

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,950
No-one ends up here

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,990
without things going to total shit
for them back out there.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,710
It's a job, not a jail.

46
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,430
Often one and the same thing.

47
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,710
So...

48
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,910
.. what went wrong for you out there?

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,390
Nothing.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,190
Bullshit.

51
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,830
It's not an interrogation!

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,470
What about you?

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,150
An icebreaker. You're learning.

54
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,150
What went to shit for you?

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,200
~ Sure you don't want that drink?
~ Did you talk your way into trouble?

56
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,910
In a roundabout way.

57
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,510
I talked to people.
Made money from it.

58
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,430
Why? What were you?

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,590
Some sort of
a Los Angeles drive-time DJ?

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,640
I was not a DJ.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,030
More like a guru.

62
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,790
Oh, don't say you were
a spiritual guru.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
I was decidedly not
a spiritual guru.

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,590
'Hello, Harry. I'm patched
through now. How are you doing?'

65
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,790
Sorry, I'm not quite dressed yet.

66
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,630
'Don't worry that's why I'm here.

67
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,190
'Just show me what
you're planning on wearing

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
'and we'll take things from there.'

69
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,190
~ How about this?
~ 'Doesn't work.

70
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,240
'It's boring blue and you're
not boring blue. Not tonight.'

71
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,910
Right. Which one of these is good?

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,230
Like I said, white shirt
with a black tie

73
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,630
with a slim-cut grey jacket.

74
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,680
Classic, timeless. Smart.

75
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,750
I don't usually do jackets.

76
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,790
You don't usually do anything.

77
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,710
And sort out that hair, because...

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,670
OK.

79
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,760
Remember those breathing
techniques we talked about, OK?

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,750
You're going to do fine.

81
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,270
It's going to be fine.

82
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,990
She's cute.

83
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,350
Yes.

84
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,550
Not out loud.

85
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,310
Absolutely.

86
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
You need to pick your spots
when you want to talk out loud. OK?

87
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,080
OK. The function room
is in the back.

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,830
Trust me, if you walk
in there like you belong,

89
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,470
no-one's going to say anything.

90
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,030
OK.

91
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,870
So what were you running,
some corporate espionage outfit?

92
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,950
Romantic services.

93
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,230
Boy meets girl thanks to...

94
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,230
"in-the-field assistance".

95
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,510
You coached dorks whilst
they cruised singles bars.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,510
Singles bars are depressing.
We'd do regular bars and clubs.

97
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,560
But at Christmas time...
we'd gate-crash office parties.

98
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,200
See, there's this dynamic
to Christmas work parties.

99
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,710
All the attractive women
have been surrounded by

100
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,710
regulation office ass-clowns
for the whole year,

101
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,710
and now they want to
let their hair down.

102
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,790
According to the pop psychologist.

103
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,870
So I know how the mind works.

104
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,310
'Now, don't stand
around like a lamppost.'

105
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,750
Walk over to the bar.

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
'Remember. Always
move with purpose.'

107
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,030
< Yeah, who's next?

108
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,150
Yeah. Can I have a...?

109
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Three pints, a vodka Diet Coke
and a shot of tequila.

110
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,030
Yeah. Don't worry about him,
all right?

111
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,390
Just grab one of those
empty bottles off the bar

112
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,990
while Captain Douchebag
orders his piss-water.

113
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,430
We're just going to need it
for a prop anyway.

114
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,310
Have a look around.

115
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,360
'See anything you like?'

116
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,750
What? The blonde?

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,710
The dark-haired girl?

118
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,990
Interesting choice.

119
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,390
Go straight over,
but focus on the blonde.

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,430
'Now. Come on.

121
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,480
'Confidence. You can do this.'

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,200
Hold on, just finding
out who they are.

123
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,470
OK, bullshit opener.

124
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,510
Try the horse story.
At the blonde girl.

125
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
Hey, so, did anyone see that
guy outside riding the horse?

126
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,670
~ Did you see him?
~ What? A guy on a horse?

127
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,550
Yeah, like, 20 minutes ago,
this guy, shirtless,

128
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,150
~ riding a horse down
the high street. ~ Really?

129
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,110
Yeah, honestly. He, er...

130
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,830
The weirdest part was that he
had a bow and arrow, right?

131
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,310
What? A real bow and arrow?

132
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,190
I swear to God.
He probably did it for a bet

133
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,710
but he looked like something
out of Tolkien, you know?

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,550
Sorry, who are you?

135
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,470
Stall until I...
until I find something.

136
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm pretty sure I'm me.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Just you're not from the office.
Who do you know from here?

138
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,710
Say, "I know you." Friendly.

139
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,760
I know you, for one.

140
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,470
Dawson.

141
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,110
Dawson, isn't it?

142
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,630
You met at Kath's barbecue.

143
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,710
Yeah. We met at
Kath's barbecue back in...

144
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
~ June. ~ .. June or so. Yeah.

145
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,470
He had a pork pie hat.

146
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,470
You had a poor guy's hat.

147
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,670
A PORK PIE hat.

148
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,720
A pork pie hat that
you wore on your head.

149
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,270
He'll pretend he remembers,
even though

150
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,870
he won't actually know if he does.

151
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,030
Right.

152
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,910
Yeah?

153
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,190
Yeah, sorry.

154
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,470
No. No, no worries. No worries.

155
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,910
Crazy night.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,990
You're doing fine.
Don't neglect the blonde.

157
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,990
You, I don't know.

158
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,870
~ Amy. ~ Amy. Hi.

159
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,710
Get her to introduce you
to the dark-haired girl.

160
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,670
So, are all of your friends
this suspicious?

161
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,830
'Nice.'

162
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,230
I don't think so.

163
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,230
This is Jennifer.

164
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,950
~ Hi, Jennifer. ~ Hi.

165
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,950
Now focus on Amy and we'll do that
funny material that we worked on.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,510
Anyway, this guy gets off the horse
and he's got a backpack, right?

167
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,190
The tactic, generally,
was to deliberately

168
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,240
freeze out the one you were
actually interested in.

169
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,990
For one thing you
wouldn't seem needy but...

170
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,040
also they would, most times,
sort of lean in naturally.

171
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,990
People want to be noticed.

172
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,470
They don't like to be shut out.
It makes them feel invisible.

173
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,520
But this girl...

174
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,760
This girl seemed content
with being ignored.

175
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,230
Maybe she could smell a loser.

176
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,150
No.

177
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,350
No. She was an outsider.

178
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,070
An attractive outsider.

179
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
There's nothing more
tantalising than that.

180
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Huh. Well, she's off. OK.

181
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,470
Gonna be a challenge. Don't quit.

182
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,030
Let's let our friend Amy here yadder
on for a little while and then, uh,

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,430
find an excuse to slip away.

184
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,480
They will sit outside on the balcony
till, like, four in the morning...

185
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,230
Listen, I've just go
to the little boys' room.

186
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,630
So just keep the party going
and I'll, you know...

187
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Sure.

188
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,190
Do you actually have to go?

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,240
'Yeah, but it's not
easy with you watching.'

190
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,800
I promise. I won't peek.

191
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,640
So you streamed everything he saw,
and he trusted you with that?

192
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:43,150
Well... it was only me watching.

193
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
'Jesus, how much urine?
He's pissing like a harpooned cow.'

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,630
'It's making me want to go.

195
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:54,680
'Well, it is!'

196
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,710
OK, there's our girl.
All right, Harry.

197
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,110
Your best bet is to just go over
and start talking to her.

198
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,790
'You just want to establish
a rapport.

199
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,630
'OK. Don't be scared of her.'

200
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,550
OK, guys, any observations
so far, helping our man out here?

201
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,750
'Here's what's interesting, she's
pretty but no-one's hitting on her.'

202
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,310
'Probably means they've given up.'

203
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,310
'She always gives them
the brush-off cos...'

204
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,070
'They're regular types, she's
an outsider with zero in common.'

205
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,630
OK that's a possible 'in'.

206
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Harry, engage in conversation,
but be cynical. Right? Cutting.

207
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,040
'Like Bonnie and Clyde, huh?
You two against the world.'

208
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:37,430
Confidence. Confidence.
Just talk to her.

209
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,670
I don't really get parties. You know?

210
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,110
You just kind of turn up and it's...
it's enforced fun, all night.

211
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,110
Talk about what TV shows
you've fallen behind on.

212
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,710
Pretend to be happy.

213
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,390
Maybe everyone else enjoys it,
maybe it's just me?

214
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,710
It's definitely not just you.

215
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Good start, now do
some more outsider small talk.

216
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,360
And keep looking at her.
I need to gauge her reactions.

217
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,950
So I noticed you sitting
alone on the edge

218
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
and I thought, "Hey, kindred spirit."

219
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,710
I really hate when people say
"kindred spirit", you know.

220
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,510
And people that do that.

221
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,590
Me too.

222
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,910
Yeah, I guess you don't
really like parties either.

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,110
The noise wrecks it for me.

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,150
All the talking and talking,
it never fucking stops.

225
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,230
OK, she curses, so should you.

226
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,670
Shit, fucking,

227
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,510
I fucking always totally think
that it's fucking shit. You know?

228
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,710
I can't think through
all the babble.

229
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,760
I only got through it last year
because I was on drugs.

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,030
I'm sorry, what's that? What's that?

231
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,110
Just, like, pills, but

232
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,160
'they must've been pretty strong
because I actually enjoyed myself.'

233
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,790
That's cool.

234
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,110
Don't say cool.

235
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,790
I wish I had some drugs right now.

236
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,390
No, you don't.

237
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,030
I'm just... I'm joking.

238
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,550
I don't take them any more.

239
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,790
Say, "That's good."

240
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,670
Well, that's good,
because you don't...

241
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,190
You don't need that
shit in your system, no.

242
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,990
'I'd say she's
a level four rock chick.'

243
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,310
'Semi-reformed. Probably respond
well to spiritual conversation.'

244
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
'I don't think I can face fucking
weeks of that. I might bail, boys.'

245
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,350
OK, look, it's too public here.

246
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,400
Ask if you can move someplace
quieter, where you can really talk.

247
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,230
People just want to be heard.

248
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,630
That's why 90% of seduction
is just listening.

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,750
Or at least pulling
a face like you're listening.

250
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,800
That works, too. The important thing
is to make them feel important.

251
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,150
Like they can make you
want to extinguish

252
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
the rest of the world
and focus on them.

253
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,670
Full attention.

254
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,870
Like you're not giving me now.
What's wrong?

255
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:58,670
~ That clock. ~ What about it?

256
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,190
I just... I just never
noticed it before.

257
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,750
In five years? Jesus.

258
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,430
Anyway, the point is
to stay locked in on them

259
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,190
long enough to build a rapport.

260
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,270
So, well, I would guess that
either every guy in there has

261
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,230
already tried to hit on you or maybe
they find you too intimidating.

262
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,750
Am I intimidating?

263
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,630
No, no, no, no, no. I'm just er...

264
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,670
No, I just imagine that they all
kind of want to get in inside your...

265
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,710
Head.

266
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,910
Head.

267
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,670
Some of them have tried.

268
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,990
Not directly. They send messages,

269
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,350
or they make it so you
know what they're thinking.

270
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,830
Yeah. That can't be fun.

271
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,230
It's just tiring, you know.

272
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,870
It just doesn't end, ever.

273
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,950
~ I wouldn't know, I never
hit on anyone. ~ Really?

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,150
OK, er...

275
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,350
ask her how long she's worked there.

276
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,510
~ 'So, how long you worked for...'
~ Magson Frank.

277
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,230
.. Magson Frank.

278
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,630
Three years.

279
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,630
Oh, wow.
So three Christmas parties...

280
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,710
This will be my last.

281
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,670
Oh, really? Are you leaving?

282
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,110
I've been planning it forever,
but you know what it's like.

283
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,390
You know you have to do it,
but when it comes right down to it,

284
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,030
it's hard to work up the courage.

285
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,590
You can empathize with that.

286
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,270
Yeah. It's like when you want
to jump into a pool,

287
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,710
and you're worried that the
water's going to be cold.

288
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,550
But you know moments after you
jump in that it'll be fine.

289
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,110
It's the fear of the
shock that holds you back.

290
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,510
Ultimately the only thing
you're worried about is

291
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,560
the transition from one state to
another, and that can't hurt you

292
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,990
because it's...
it's just a state change.

293
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,990
Great stuff, kid.
Almost word-for-word.

294
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,910
That's exactly right,
it's just a state change.

295
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,470
Right. And it's frustrating cos
you've always got these ten

296
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,750
voices in your head saying,

297
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,430
"Don't do it" and another
ten in your head saying, "Do it".

298
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,550
Which one do you listen to?

299
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,790
The "do it"s.

300
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,190
Really?

301
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,830
Yeah. If you don't like it,
you can just cut and run.

302
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,430
You know, get it over and done with.

303
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,480
You're right. I will.

304
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,310
Well.

305
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,230
To changing states.

306
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,350
To changing states.

307
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,750
Sorry.

308
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,830
'She touched his knee.'

309
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,430
'She touched his fucking knee!'

310
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,950
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
please, please.

311
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Harry, you're doing great. Ask her
if she would like another drink.

312
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,990
Listen. Let me get you another drink.

313
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,430
Let me think.

314
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I just need the loo a sec.

315
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,070
So thanks to you some gawko
finally meets a girl.

316
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,110
It's not much of a Christmas story.

317
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,430
I haven't finished yet.

318
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Maybe he comes down her chimney.

319
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,950
~ I just don't feel
comfortable doing this. ~ What?

320
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,710
I mean she... I like her.

321
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,870
She likes you.

322
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,920
It's cheating. I'd never have even
had the nerve to talk to her.

323
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,110
Aren't you glad you did?

324
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,830
Yeah, I... Yes. Yes.
But I just...

325
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,630
It's just a bit of a nightmare
having you, you know,

326
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,750
all of you in my head,
watching us...

327
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,710
Telling me what to do.

328
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,830
I just want to talk to her myself.

329
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,110
And it's... it's
a bit of a head-fuck.

330
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,190
I kind of want you all to go away...

331
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,240
Hey.

332
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,310
~ Come back to mine. ~ Sorry?

333
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,550
I want you to come back to mine.

334
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,390
I thought about asking you,
and a little voice said, "Do it".

335
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,870
So I'm doing it.

336
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,990
Um... uh...

337
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,430
Say yes!

338
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,870
I want to do this.

339
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
It's my way of saying thanks.

340
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,110
Sorry.

341
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,630
No.

342
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,750
'Hole-in-one!'

343
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,630
'On his first run!
His first bloody run!'

344
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,680
~ Just say yes.
~ Yes. Yes. Yes.

345
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,870
I don't usually bring
people back here.

346
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,870
Well, I'm honoured.

347
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,070
Come in.

348
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,390
Did you watch?

349
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,390
When they went back to hers and got
up to whatever they got up to...

350
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,440
did you carry on watching
through his eyes?

351
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,230
What do you think I am?

352
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,990
Clearly, I don't know.

353
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,670
Maybe if you spoke to me
more, you'd know.

354
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,470
No. My job was done.

355
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,630
Of course I didn't watch.

356
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,670
~ 'Here? ~ Mm-hm. ~ OK.'

357
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,750
Nice place.
I like the mantelpiece...

358
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,350
and that bird.

359
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,190
Kooky decor...

360
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:53,240
'Indicating sexual adventurousness.'

361
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,550
I'll get the drinks.

362
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,150
~ Yeah, OK. I'll just sit...
~ The bedroom's that way.

363
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,200
~ Yeah, OK.
~ I'll meet you in there.

364
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,970
OK, Harry.

365
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,050
You're going to the moon.

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,490
Just sooner than expected.

367
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,010
~ I can't... I can't do it.
~ This is first-time nerves.

368
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,970
It's all happening so suddenly.
I didn't expect this, this quickly.

369
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,330
You just got to roll with it.

370
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,090
I don't want you
all to see, all right?

371
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,140
~ 'Oh, now he's Mr Fucking Ethics.'
~ Wait. You were happy to take a window
seat while others did it.

372
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,380
~ That was different! ~ 'I didn't hear
any objections when he watched me
getting sucked off

373
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,010
'by that German girl.
That was a first date.'

374
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,490
~ 'Refund.' ~ Look, she's too real.
This is too real.

375
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,690
Nothing is too real.

376
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,740
Yeah, but...

377
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,490
You're standing.

378
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah, I... I just didn't want
to be too presumptuous.

379
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,650
I need you on the bed.

380
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,700
'Jesus!'

381
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,980
(They can't fucking wait.)

382
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,730
'Is she going to take that top off?

383
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,690
'If there's no tits.
I want a discount.

384
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,410
'They're going to have sex.
You're getting the season
finale in episode one.

385
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,650
'Yeah, but if I don't see
her tits...'

386
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,700
Will you please be patient?
Jesus... have some respect.

387
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,130
'Hey. Are you OK in there?'

388
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,170
Wow. What is that?

389
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,220
"Fuck them" is what it is.
A big glass of "fuck them".

390
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,690
Fuck who?

391
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,010
Always saying what to do,
half saying one thing,

392
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,490
half saying another.

393
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,050
The talk, the constant talk.

394
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,930
'This isn't good.
I'm not getting tits, am I?'

395
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,010
'I stopped taking the pills
they said I should take,

396
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,810
'because they dulled the sound.'

397
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,860
'Always, they've spoken to me,
always there, and I've had it.'

398
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,170
Harry, I think we should
think about wrapping this up.

399
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:23,220
I was planning on drinking
this tonight to make them stop,
but I was wavering.

400
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,290
Coward, fucking coward,

401
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,340
and then I met you, and it was fate.

402
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,010
You knew what it was like
and you said do it.

403
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,060
So now, we're saying "fuck it"
together.

404
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,770
~ What's in the drink?
~ It doesn't matter. Wrap it up.

405
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,530
I know you hear them too.
I saw you talking to them.

406
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,690
No. They're real people,
these are real people.

407
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,330
There's no such thing
as real people.

408
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,970
Harry, get out of there now!

409
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,090
It's like a club, it's a club,
where we meet girls

410
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,290
and they talk us through...

411
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,570
~ No-one understands me, either.
~ No.

412
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,170
All night, they've been watching us
and there's this one guy,

413
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,330
he's the leader.
He's the leader.

414
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,210
We're the same.

415
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,770
They are watching us.
All night, they've been watching.

416
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,730
They can see you. They can see me.

417
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,290
No-one understands what that's like.

418
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,010
There are a hundred
who see through me,

419
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:19,060
standing at their government depots,
shouting what to think.

420
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,690
Not any more.

421
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,810
~ You too.
~ I don't want it.

422
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,170
~ It's a state change.
~ I don't want it.

423
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,970
It's just a transition

424
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,730
and soon, they won't be there
and we'll be free.

425
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,490
Please... Please... I don't want it.

426
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,970
You do.

427
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,130
You do. Sh...

428
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,210
You do.

429
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,890
She murdered him?

430
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,730
A mercy killing, she'd say.

431
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,930
So, when did you find out
about this?

432
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,980
I mean, when did you know
that this had happened?

433
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,210
I saw it on a newscast, I think.

434
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,650
Wipe and destroy everything. OK?
Everything.

435
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,700
Now go.

436
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,530
Matthew?

437
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:15,930
What's going on?

438
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,610
What are you doing?

439
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,850
So Claire... she was my wife.

440
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,690
She's British, you'd like her.

441
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,450
And I'm your wife, in fact.

442
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,490
'Claire found out I was involved

443
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,330
'and took what you might call
a dim view.'

444
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,690
She blocked me.

445
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,010
You ever been blocked?

446
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,210
I've had enough. Matthew, it's done.

447
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,260
~ Stop it. Stop.
~ Not this time.

448
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,730
'It drives you crazy.

449
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,370
'Once they hit that button,
that's it, you're locked out.'

450
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,530
End of conversation.
You can't hear or speak to them.

451
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,930
They can't hear or speak to you.

452
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,980
Every time you look at them,
there's just this... anonymous shape.

453
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,900
It usually only lasts
for about, like, an hour.

454
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,210
But when they leave it going,

455
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,810
oh, shit.

456
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Price of progress, I suppose.

457
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,890
We all got...
We all got Zed-Eyes put in, right.

458
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,970
Which is all fine and dandy
until something like this happens

459
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,690
and then it's bullshit.

460
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,740
You can't even take them out.

461
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:46,460
Packet gravy. How British.

462
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,180
Merry Christmas.

463
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:10,300
Now we're festive. Huh?

464
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,900
To Christmas!

465
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:26,060
Anyway, she left me, took custody
of Mel - that's our daughter.

466
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,370
Hence stranding me
in this lovely place.

467
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,650
I didn't want to be
surrounded by reminders.

468
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,450
What?

469
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,970
Did you hear that?

470
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Hear what?

471
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Well, anyway, I'm glad we're talking.
Silence can be oppressive.

472
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,050
You think weird shit in a vacuum,
huh?

473
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:07,100
I mean, you feel better, right?
Communicating?

474
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,130
Talking to me, finally?

475
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:14,130
A little bit, maybe. Yeah.

476
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,180
You're a locked box.

477
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,610
I mean, that's a good thing.

478
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,450
Most people are too easy to read,
especially if you know minds.

479
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,450
Using party tricks to pick up girls
isn't knowing minds.

480
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,650
The picking up girls thing
was a hobby.

481
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,700
My job was completely different.

482
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,090
You'll never guess what that was.

483
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,850
Marketing person?

484
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,770
No.

485
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,530
~ Door-to-door salesman?
~ Please.

486
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,210
Proctologist?

487
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,610
You're never going to get it.

488
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,130
I'm not going to try.

489
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,180
All right. Let's make it a game.

490
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,370
I'll describe to you...

491
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:08,420
.. my day at work, and you stop me
when you've guessed it.

492
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,290
'The extreme weather has hit
sales hard this Christmas.

493
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,890
'Five inches of snow...'

494
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,450
'That's going to wreck my portfolio
just when I need it.'

495
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:22,450
'Don't know what I'm going to do
about that. Oh, God, more messages.

496
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,370
'I'll never clear this inbox.'

497
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,290
Sorry. Constant bloody admin.

498
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,090
Just time for a little snack.

499
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,010
I can eat before an operation?

500
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,930
Wonders of modern science.

501
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:38,690
Oh, thank God. I'm starving.

502
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,610
'That toast looks burnt.

503
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,290
'Should I say something?

504
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,090
'Yeah, I think I'll say
something.'

505
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,810
All good?

506
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,810
To be honest, it's not quite how
I like it.

507
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,650
It's a bit overdone.

508
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,410
Sorry.

509
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,170
I'll make some more.

510
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,220
'She hates me now.

511
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,290
'How long is this going to take?'

512
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,250
Hi, I'm Madge.
I'm your anaesthetist today.

513
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,450
Hi.

514
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,410
'God, she's young.
Hope she's qualified.

515
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,130
'OK, stop thinking about things
that could go wrong.

516
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,180
'They said it's straightforward and
painless. I'm just going to relax.

517
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,250
'OK, just relax. Here we go.'

518
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,730
Now, just count backwards
from ten.

519
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

520
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,010
six, five...

521
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,060
.. four, three, two, one.

522
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,050
'I can't... I can't see.

523
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,970
'Where my am I?'

524
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,370
'What's that noise?'

525
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,090
'Why can't I see?!'

526
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:50,690
Preparing to extract cookie.

527
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,050
'What? No! Wait! I'm still awake!

528
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,330
'Oh, my God!

529
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,170
'Oh, my God! What's happening?
Excuse me? Oh, my God!'

530
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,170
'That's me!

531
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,730
'That's me! Oh, my God! Where am I?

532
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,490
'I don't know what's happening!

533
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,090
'I don't know what's happening to me!

534
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
'Hello?

535
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,130
'Is... is anyone there?

536
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
'Hello?'

537
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,130
Ow!

538
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:31,180
Sorry.

539
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,340
You're probably pretty weirded out
right now, I'm guessing.

540
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,860
It's OK, you can talk.
I can hear you through this.

541
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,770
~ Hello. ~ Hi.

542
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,820
I'm Matthew,
I'm from Smartelligence.

543
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,340
My job is to explain what's
happening to you as best I can.

544
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,050
~ Oh, my God! Am I dead?
~ No, no. You're not dead.

545
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:01,450
No-one's dead here.

546
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:05,500
How old did you say you we're, 30?

547
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,170
29.

548
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,650
29, right. So you won't remember
Xerox machines?

549
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,210
~ Do you know what a photocopier is?
~ What?

550
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,210
Do you know what a copy is?

551
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,610
As in a copy of something?
Of course I know what that is.

552
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,050
Well, that's what you are.

553
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,490
A copy of?

554
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,690
A copy of you.

555
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,450
~ But I am me. ~ OK.

556
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Try to blow on my face.

557
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,460
You can't, because you don't have
a body.

558
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,410
Where are your fingers?

559
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,460
Your arms, your face? Nowhere.

560
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,050
Because you're code.

561
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,810
You're a simulated brain
full of code,

562
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:56,330
stored in this little widget
we call a cookie.

563
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,530
Why have you done this to me?

564
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,170
Ah, well...
Actually you did this to you.

565
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,370
Real you is paying for this.

566
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,330
I don't understand.

567
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,330
You see, what this is, is a service.

568
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,410
We take a blank cookie

569
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,460
and we surgically implant it
into a client's brain.

570
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:19,700
It sits there just under the skin
for about a week, shadowing.

571
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,530
Soaking up the way
this particular mind works.

572
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,490
That's why you think you're you.
You are you.

573
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,540
But also not.

574
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Right. Well, it is a lot to process.
Even from inside a processor.

575
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,810
Put me back in my body!

576
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,250
Hm. That's where real you lives.

577
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,610
But...

578
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,170
What we will do though is
we will give you a simulated body.

579
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,370
We find that sometimes that helps.
Are you ready?

580
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,420
~ What? I don't understand!
~ Three, and two, one.

581
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,450
Hey.

582
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Better?

583
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,890
This is my body.

584
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,940
Let's not get into that again.
Look around you.

585
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:30,580
You've got a control room.

586
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,450
What's this for?

587
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,370
That console,
that's for you to control the house.

588
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,690
I mean, real you's house.

589
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:42,490
Look. How do you like your toast?

590
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,540
~ What? ~ How do you like your toast?

591
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:51,290
~ Underdone. Slightly underdone.
~ OK, perfect.

592
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,050
Think about how you like it,

593
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,100
then just press the button.

594
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,610
Which one?

595
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,250
It doesn't matter. You already know
you're making toast.

596
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,300
The buttons are symbolic mostly
anyway.

597
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,050
See, this is your job now.

598
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,650
You're in charge of everything here.

599
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,250
The temperature, the lighting,

600
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,010
what time the alarm clock
goes off in the morning.

601
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,650
If there's
no food in the refrigerator.

602
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:30,410
You...
You're in charge of ordering it.

603
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,450
~ For who? ~ For real you. She's paying.

604
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Where is real me?

605
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,020
Taking a nap. In the bedroom.
Top right.

606
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,330
I don't want to be in here.

607
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,890
I don't want to be in here.

608
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,770
I don't want to be in here!

609
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,010
Hey! Just how you like it.

610
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,130
OK. Please stop screaming.

611
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,010
Are you going to stop screaming?

612
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,060
Are you going to stop screaming?
No. OK.

613
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:21,740
I'm sorry. I had to mute you.

614
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:29,340
Oh, sorry.

615
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,820
Look. It'll be much easier
if you just comply.

616
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,490
I'm not doing this.

617
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,210
I'm not some sort of
push-button toaster monkey.

618
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,250
~ Would you prefer to do nothing?
~ Well, I'm not doing this!

619
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Right. Well, nothing it is then.
Let me show you what that is like.

620
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,410
Three weeks sound good?
That should give you a taste.

621
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,050
What do you mean, three weeks?

622
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:59,100
If you just wait for a...
Just...

623
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,940
What about now?

624
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,610
Please.

625
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,370
Don't do that again.

626
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,420
Please. There's nothing to do here.
There's nothing. There's just...

627
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,450
I mean, there's nothing.

628
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,130
~ I did warn you.
~ I couldn't even sleep.

629
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,010
You don't need sleep.

630
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,490
Ready to go to work?

631
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,540
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not.
Definitely not doing that.

632
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,020
~ OK. Well, have six months.
~ No. Wait, wait!

633
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,210
See, the trick of it
lay in breaking them

634
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:58,260
without letting them snap
completely, if you get me.

635
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,330
Too much time in solitary
and they'd just wig out.

636
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,330
No use to anyone,
then you'd just sell them cheap

637
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,730
to the games industry,
they'd become...

638
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:12,780
cannon fodder for some war thing.

639
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,420
How are we feeling now?

640
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,330
Please.

641
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,890
Give me something to do.

642
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,970
Ready to work?

643
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,610
Yes, please. I'll do anything.

644
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,660
Just give me something to do, please.

645
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,930
OK.

646
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:53,980
Great toast, by the way.

647
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,570
Hey.

648
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,050
Is it set up?

649
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,100
You are all set and ready to go.

650
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,260
You know, as I was coming here,
I saw this guy with his shirt off,

651
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:22,530
riding a horse
in the middle of the street.

652
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,770
How weird.

653
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:28,820
I swear to God.

654
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,780
MUSIC: The Thieving Magpie
by Rossini

655
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,850
Good morning, Greta.

656
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,530
Here are today's appointments.

657
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:58,580
11am - hair with Stelios.

658
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:04,420
12.30 - Lunch at Barney's Brassiere
with Annabel.

659
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,260
3pm - Jackanape Gallery
private view, Shoreditch.

660
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,820
6.30 - Christmas drinks with Paolo.

661
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,100
7.30 - The Nutcracker,
Royal Opera House.

662
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,450
That's slavery.

663
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,210
A little melodramatic, isn't it?

664
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,850
But she thought she was real.

665
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,890
~ But she wasn't. ~ It's barbaric.

666
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:34,940
It wasn't really real,
so it wasn't really barbaric.

667
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,300
Again, you are not who I expected.

668
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,530
Most people would say,

669
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:54,580
"She's only made of code,
she's not real. Fuck her."

670
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,930
But you're empathetic.

671
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:01,980
~ You care about people. ~ Don't you?

672
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,850
You're a good man.

673
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,970
Am I?

674
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,290
Based on how you've reacted
to what I've said, yeah.

675
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,340
I can tell you're kind...

676
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,020
I'm not a good man.

677
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,500
A good man who's done bad things?

678
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,090
You can tell me about it.

679
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,570
I've done stuff in my life
I'm not proud of.

680
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,620
I can't pretend I haven't.

681
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,980
Was it something to do
with your family?

682
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,970
Wife?

683
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,020
Girlfriend?

684
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,580
It's just us here.

685
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:11,180
Her dad never liked me.

686
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:15,620
He never liked me.

687
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:26,860
It's cold, isn't it? Come on.

688
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:32,220
~ Beth. Bethany. ~ Dad, what now?

689
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,610
~ It gets dark about six.
~ We won't be that long!

690
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:39,660
Hold on. Let me put my glove on.

691
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:42,410
I think he disapproves.

692
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,450
He's just protective.

693
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,330
He thinks I'm not good enough
for you.

694
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Well, I mean, he's got a point.

695
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Let me take a photo of you.
Stand there.

696
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,210
I feel so awkward posing.

697
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,090
Come on. Be a supermodel.

698
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:08,050
~ This awkward enough for you?
~ It's perfect.

699
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:12,100
Right. Ready?
That's nice. Hold it there.

700
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:18,980
You're such a dick.

What you doing round there?
Why are you all around there?

716
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,190
~ No. No, we're going home. Come on.
~ Don't manhandle me.

00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,310
I'm not going to get up

I'm not going to get up.
I'm not going to get up.

~ Come on, Joe. ~ Come on.

721
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:47,270
Cheers, mate.

722
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:51,320
Things weren't perfection.
These things never are, but...

723
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,560
.. we were really happy.

724
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,190
I'll let Gita tell the story.

725
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,240
She loves boring people
with our personal details.

726
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,430
I'd been working there
for about a fortnight

727
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,480
when Beth introduced the two of us,
and ta-da!

728
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,750
So it's all Beth's doing.

729
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,030
She's the puppet-master.

730
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,470
What was her tip
for winning me over again?

731
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,630
Not to let you hear me snore.

732
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,470
We all went on this work trip once,
before Gita's time.

733
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,150
I fell asleep on the coach back
and snored so loud

734
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,910
they all thought there was
something wrong with me.

735
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,870
He snores like a bison.

736
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,670
Wow.

737
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,470
Really, you're telling him that?

738
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,520
Oh, another one bites the dust.

739
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,950
I think she's more into him
than he's into her.

740
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Don't you think?

741
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,120
~ Is that one finished? ~ Mmm-hmm. ~ Yeah?

742
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,310
You all right?

743
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,470
~ I'm tired. ~ You've been a bit quiet.

744
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,790
Just wasn't in the mood, you know?

745
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,840
I see them all the time at work.

746
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:04,710
I think I'm going to go to bed.
Do you mind?

747
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,760
No, that's fine.

748
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,960
(Shit.)

749
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,070
Beth?

750
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,150
What?

751
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,910
Is this yours?

752
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,960
I just found it in the bin.
That means pregnant.

753
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:58,120
Is it yours?

754
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:02,240
Yes.

755
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,390
I mean, that...

756
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:08,440
Christ.

757
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,910
That's amazing, I mean...
It's just...

758
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,230
Joe, I can't.

759
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,190
A baby, a pregnancy... not now.

760
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,390
Not right now, I can't.

761
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,750
Of course you can.
My God, you'll be an amazing mum.

762
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,310
~ No. I'm 27, I'm not ready.
~ Who's ever ready?

763
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:30,360
It's not... it's just too quick, OK?
It's all too quick.

764
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,510
We'll manage. I'll surprise you.

765
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,910
You're not listening.

766
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:35,870
~ I can be pretty responsible
when pushed. ~ Joe.

767
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,910
You can put your feet up,
I'll do shoulder rubs,

768
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:39,510
~ I'll paint the house...
~ Joe, please.

769
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,310
~ We'll be like a couple
in a DIY ad... ~ Joe.

770
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,360
~ We'll be like a family.
~ I don't want it.

771
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,520
~ But it's a baby. ~ Joe.

772
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,910
I mean, it's our baby.

773
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,350
I know, and it's not easy for me.

774
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,030
~ Well, let's at least discuss this.
~ No. I've made up my mind.

775
00:48:58,080 --> 00:49:02,080
Well, I haven't.

776
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,750
God, look at you.

777
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,710
You're pissed.

778
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:09,470
You drank all night, Beth.

779
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,390
You drank all night.

780
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,910
Jesus Christ, you're pregnant.

781
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,990
Yeah, well, I don't want to be.

782
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,750
And I'm not going to be.

783
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,550
~ You're being a bitch. ~ Stop it.

784
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,070
~ You're being a cold bitch who would
kill a kid. ~ That's not fair.

785
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,510
Who'd get it torn out
because it doesn't suit her plans.

786
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:26,830
Stop or I'll block you.

787
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,070
Don't you dare.

788
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,190
No. We can talk tomorrow,
just please stop.

789
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,510
Don't you fucking dare.

790
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:32,910
Beth!

791
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,550
Turn it off.

792
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,710
Turn it off, you...

793
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,310
Turn it off, Beth!

794
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:39,870
Listen to me, Beth.

795
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,630
Turn it off.

796
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,310
You turn it off!

797
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:47,360
Turn it off.

798
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,950
You turn it off, Beth!

799
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,430
Beth?

800
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:55,430
Turn it..... off! Please.

801
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Turn it off.

802
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,430
Beth?

803
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,310
Wait!

804
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,270
I'm sorry, I was pissed.

805
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,790
Can we just talk about this
properly, please?

806
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:32,950
I've said some really awful shit.
Beth, I love you.

807
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,630
Listen, we can work this out.

808
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,270
No, Beth...

809
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,310
Beth, please!

810
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:44,360
Beth!

811
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,110
That day, I didn't go to work.

812
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,030
I just stayed at home and...

813
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,750
.. tried to work out
how to make amends.

814
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,230
But she just didn't come back.

815
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:02,280
And thanks to the block,
I couldn't...

816
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,230
I couldn't message her.
I couldn't call her.

817
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,190
After a week, I was pretty desperate.

818
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,240
So I just hung around
outside her work, like a stalker.

819
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:17,430
Tim! Gita!

820
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,070
Have you seen Beth?

821
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,990
She left.

822
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,270
Left. What, like...?

823
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,910
Handed in her notice.

824
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,960
No-one knows where she is.

825
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,750
Joe?

826
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,990
~ Joe! ~ No, leave him.

827
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:41,070
I was still hopeful
that she would get in touch,

828
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,030
or at least remove the block
so that I could contact her.

829
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,070
But no.

830
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,070
When there's a block,
you can't even wallow properly.

831
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:53,630
You can't switch it off.

832
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,430
You can't take the Zed-Eyes out.

833
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,480
And it doesn't just block them,
it blocks every image of them.

834
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,800
So every memory
I had of her was vandalised.

835
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:14,400
And then one day
I'm out in town and...

836
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,670
.. it was her.

837
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,720
She was pregnant.

838
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,470
She'd kept it.

839
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,030
Well, I just sort of lost it.

840
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,470
I just ran over and started
pleading with her. Just pleading.

841
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:40,190
Turn it off. Turn it off.
Just turn it off.

842
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,630
Turn it off. Beth, turn it off.

843
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,590
Help. Get off me!

844
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,640
Some passer-by called the police.
They took me down the station.

845
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,280
And that was that.

846
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,550
So, by now, the block's
got legal backing.

847
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,310
And there's a GPS so that if I go
within ten metres of her,

848
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:04,360
bang - I get arrested.

849
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,910
Harsh.

850
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,750
Yeah, and I've got no idea
where she is.

851
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,590
If...
Whether she's had the baby or not.

852
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,110
Whether it's a boy or a girl.

853
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,310
If it's OK.

854
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:21,790
I've got absolutely no way
of getting in touch with her.

855
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,750
Except I knew where her dad lived.

856
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,800
So I write her a letter,
this begging letter.

857
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,640
Laying it all out, you know,
and I get no response.

858
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:42,040
So I write again...

859
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:46,470
.. and again...

860
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,350
.. and again.

861
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:53,400
No response.

862
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,550
She cut you out good.

863
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,950
But there was one thing I could do.

864
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,950
I knew she spent every Christmas
with him at his place,

865
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
so I knew that she would
definitely be there.

866
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,400
So, the day before,
Christmas Eve, I headed up.

867
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:16,470
And where her dad lived
was this isolated place

868
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,310
in the back of beyond.

869
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,030
I'd never been up there without her.

870
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:25,790
It was weird being on the outside.

871
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,950
I waited there all day. Until...

872
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,830
Well, I had to take a closer look.

873
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,990
And there's her dad with our baby,

874
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,270
but I can't even see its face
because...

875
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Legal blocks cover offspring too.

876
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,670
Been there.

877
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,720
That hurts.

878
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,280
I couldn't even tell
if it was a boy or a girl.

879
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,040
I know this sounds stupid...

880
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:28,110
.. but seeing something...

881
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,160
.. was better than nothing.

882
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:36,600
So I kept going back.

883
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,800
It became an annual pilgrimage.

884
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,040
Once a year I'd head up there
and watch them from a distance.

885
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,800
Watching the kid grow up, you know?

886
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:06,630
More than anything I just wanted
to make some sort of contact.

887
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,430
Anything.

888
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,190
So, one Christmas, kid must have
been about four by now,

889
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,240
I headed up there
and I took a little present with me.

890
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:20,640
Just a small, stupid thing.

891
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,840
For the first time,
I could see she was a girl.

892
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,280
I had a daughter.

893
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:41,790
So, Santa Claus...

894
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,470
.. did you try it again next year?

895
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,520
Something happened before then.

896
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:00,450
'It had been a few months since

897
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,370
'I'd been up there
to look at my daughter.

898
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,420
'I was just sat at home watching TV,
flipping through the channels.'

899
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,650
'.. which claimed the lives of 26
people on a quiet Wednesday morning.

900
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,490
'Passengers like Palab Ghatak,

902
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:20,180

who'd only recently started...'

903
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,850
It had been so long since
I'd seen her, it was hard to imagine

904
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:30,090
anything but that shadow
in her place.

905
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:34,140
But now that the block
had died with her...

906
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,130
.. there she was.

907
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:41,450
She was gone.

908
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,500
Sorry.

909
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:56,410
But there was one silver lining...

910
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:57,850
With the block gone.

911
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,900
You'd get to see your daughter.

I didn't tell them.

And what about the girl?

972
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,100
What happened to the girl?

973
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,810
I only know what they said.

974
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:11,860

978
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:31,500
Joe, stay with me.
What did they say?

979
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:33,450
What did they say, Joe?

980
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:37,500
That she just...
she just stayed in the house.

981
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,490
It was, um...

982
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:55,250
It was Christmas Eve, so she just...

983
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:59,300
.. she just stayed hidden.
She didn't move.

984
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:09,380
Then on Boxing Day she realised
that no-one was going to help.

985
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:18,900
And she gave her grandad
a present that she'd made.

986
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:30,500
And she went out to go and get help.

987
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:45,940
How far did she get?

988
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,010
Oh, may God forgive me.
God forgive me.

989
01:05:57,060 --> 01:06:00,250
So you confess?

990
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:04,300
Joe?

991
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:10,170
Just say it.

992
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,220
Just let it out.

993
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:22,890
I confess.

994
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,850
I confess.

995
01:06:34,260 --> 01:06:36,090
Whoo! I knew I could do it.

996
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,610
Boom! I told you I'd get it.

997
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:42,250
All right, I'm coming out.

998
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:46,300
Sorry, Joe.

999
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:07,090
Well? That had to be enough...

1000
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,450
Full confession. Clear conviction.

1001
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:11,170
Well done.

1002
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,930
Two days we pressed him
and he said piss all,

1003
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:16,330
this bastard cracks him
in 70 minutes.

1004
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,170
He knows he's guilty,
he needed to unload.

1005
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,930
It wasn't really 70 minutes,
not to him.

1006
01:07:22,980 --> 01:07:26,090
When he was first ingested,
I tweaked the time preferences,

1007
01:07:26,140 --> 01:07:30,140
made it seam like five years
from his perspective.

1008
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:34,220
Some might say that five years
with me is punishment enough.

1009
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:38,860
Wait here.

1010
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:46,450
Mr Potter.

1011
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:49,170
Congratulations on your confession.

1012
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:53,220
That cookie we took out of your head
just gave us the full story.

1013
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,570
So you can keep the silent act up
as long as you want.

1014
01:07:56,620 --> 01:08:00,620
Makes no difference -
you've already talked.

1015
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,180
Also, Merry Christmas.

1016
01:08:16,540 --> 01:08:18,810
So...

1017
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,050
The deal?

1018
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:25,100
Break a confession from him
and I go free, right?

1019
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,690
I'm the expert, you needed me...

1020
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:30,850
That's one for the Home Office.

1021
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:34,900
We'll make good on the offer.
You're free to go, Mr Trent.

1022
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,090
With some caveats.

1023
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,850
~ Caveats?
~ You'll be on the register.

1024

01:08:43,740 --> 01:08:45,930
The one for Peeping Tom pervs.

1026
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:49,650
All I did was help some lonely guys
by providing a service.

1027
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:50,970
An illegal service.

1028
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:53,530
You also failed to report a murder -

1029

fatal poisoning,
in case you've forgotten.

1030
